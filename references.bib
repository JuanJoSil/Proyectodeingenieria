We demonstrate that the link between the purity of the mixed states and the probability of entanglement is not sensitive to the measure chosen. Since the criterion of partial transposition is not sufficient to distinguish all separable states for N 8, we develop an efficient algorithm to calculate numerically the entanglement of formation of a given mixed quantum state, which allows us to compute the volume of separable states for N 8 and to estimate the volume of the bound entangled states in this case.},

We propose a natural measure in the space of density matrices describing N-dimensional quantum systems. We prove that, under this measure, the set of separable states possesses a nonzero volume. Analytical lower and upper bounds of this volume are also derived for N 2 2 and N 2 3 cases. Finally, numerical Monte Carlo calculations allow us to estimate the volume of separable states, providing numerical evidence that it decreases exponentially with the dimension of the composite system. We have also analyzed a conditional measure of separability under the condition of fixed purity. Our results display a clear dualism between purity and separability: entanglement is typical of pure states, while separability is connected with quantum mixtures. In particular, states of sufficiently low purity are necessarily separable.},

The cavity is mounted on the science platform on top of a vibration isolation system. The optical cavity works in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics and serves as a quantum optical detector for single atoms. This system enables us to study atom optics on a single particle level and to further develop the field of quantum atom optics. We describe the technological modules and the operation of the combined BEC cavity apparatus. Its performance is characterized by single atom detection measurements for thermal and quantum degenerate atomic beams. The atom laser provides a fast and controllable supply of atoms coupling with the cavity mode and allows for an efficient study of atom field interactions in the strong coupling regime. Moreover, the high detection efficiency for quantum degenerate atoms distinguishes the cavity as a sensitive and weakly invasive probe for cold atomic clouds.},

We find that localization is delayed by incoherence: the more incoherent the waves are, the longer they diffusively spread while propagating in the medium. However, if all the eigenmodes of the system are exponentially localized (as in one- and two-dimensional disordered systems), any partially incoherent wavepacket eventually exhibits localization with exponentially decaying tails, after sufficiently long propagation distances. Interestingly, we find that the asymptotic behavior of the incoherent beam is similar to that of a single instantaneous coherent realization of the beam.},

The standard JCM is obtained for p=q=1. The quantum collapse and revival effects and the squeezing properties of a particular variant of the (p,q)-deformed Jaynes-Cummings model are studied numerically. The model is based on the q-deformed oscillator algebra AA°-qA°A=1 that interpolates between Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. If the cavity field is prepared initially in a q-deformed coherent state, the quantum collapse and revival effects are observed only for q≊1. For q>1, the atomic inversion σ3(t) exhibits chaoticlike behavior, which is a feature observed also in other q-deformed JCM’s. Strong squeezing is observed only for small positive and small negative q values. If q≊1, the squeezing is very weak. In the limit q=1±ɛ with ɛ≪1, the algebra can be interpreted as describing a small violation of Bose-Einstein statistics in the JCM.},

The phenomenon of squeezing is also observed in the normal, the variance, and the entropy squeezing. However, the maximum value of the squeezing beside its period depends in general on the variation of the field frequency $\omega$ as well as the $\mu$-parameter, both of which play a crucial role to control this phenomenon.},

This paper suggests that the concurrence hierarchy as an entanglement measure provides an alternative view of how to think about this problem. We consider mixed states of two qubits and obtain an exact solution of the time-dependent master equation that describes the evolution of two two-level qubits (or atoms) within a perfect cavity for the case of multiphoton transition. We consider the situation for which the field may start from a binomial state. Employing this solution, the significant features of the entanglement when a second qubit is weakly coupled to the field and becomes entangled with the first qubit, is investigated. We also describe the response of the atomic system as it varies between the Rabi oscillations and the collapse–revival mode and investigate the atomic inversion and the Q-function. We identify and numerically demonstrate the region of parameters where significantly large entanglement can be obtained. Most interestingly, it is shown that features of the entanglement are influenced significantly when the multi-photon process is involved. Finally, we obtain illustrative examples of some novel aspects of this system and show how the off-resonant case can sensitize entanglement to the role of initial state setting.},

A factorization of the initial density operator is assumed, with the privileged field mode being in the SDFS. We invoke the mathematical notion of maximum variation of a function to construct a measure for entropy fluctuations. The results show that the effect of the SDFS changes the quasiperiod of the field entropy evolution and entanglement between the atom and the field. The Rabi oscillation frequency, the collapse and revival times of the atomic coherence are found to have strikingly different photon-intensity dependent than those found previously.

We present a derivation of the unitary operator within the frame of the dressed state approach, by means of which we identify and numerically demonstrate the region of parameters where significantly large entanglement can be obtained. The influences of the nonlinearity, Stark shifts and detuning on the degree of entanglement are examined. It is shown that features of the degree of entanglement are influenced significantly by the kinds of nonlinearity of the single-mode field. The model presented in this paper can be regarded as a generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings model.},

Employing this solution, the significant features of the entanglement when a second qubit is allowed to interact with cavity mode and becomes entangled with the first qubit are investigated in the context of the measure defined by negative eigenvalues for the partial transposition of the density operator. The effects of Stark shift, distance between the two qubits, and an instantaneous phase shift experienced by the second qubit on the entanglement and probability amplitudes are indicated. It has been shown that the entanglement as well as the intensity are markedly affected by different parameters when the nonlinear two-photon process is involved. Moreover, the quasiprobability distribution function is investigated before and after the sudden phase shift experienced by the second qubit. We believe that this may throw some light on the question of the entanglement of multi-qubit systems.},

The patterns of knowledge diffusion from the US to Brazil and Mexico, and Korea and Taiwan during the 1976-2002 period are quite different. We found that the South East Asian countries had a higher number of patents granted in USPTO than their Latin American counterparts. Furthermore, the technologies registered in Korea and Taiwan were of high technology (Information and Communications, Electric and Electronics, etc.) meanwhile in Latin America (Brazil and Mexico) the technologies registered were of traditional tech fields (mechanical, chemical, etc.). Besides, the citations received (forward) by Korea and Taiwan outnumbers the citations received by Mexico and Brazil. That means that the value of knowledge in Asian countries is more important than it is in Latin American countries. This is very relevant because in the beginning of the analyzed period Latin American countries had the same technological distribution as these Asian countries.},

We prove that a larger violation, or equivalently a stronger resistance to noise, is found for a nonmaximally entangled state. It is shown that the resistance to noise is not a good measure of nonlocality and we introduce some other possible measures. The nonmaximally entangled state turns out to be more robust also for these alternative measures. From these results it follows that two von Neumann measurements per party may be not optimal for detecting nonlocality. For d53,4, we point out some connections between this inequality and distillability. Indeed, we demonstrate that any state violating it, with the optimal von Neumann settings, is distillable.}

An effectively one-dimensional (1D) configuration is considered, assuming strong transverse confinement; in parallel, a proper 1D model of the DFG (which amounts to the known quintic equation for the Tonks-Girardeau gas in the OL) is considered too. The FGSs found in the first two bandgaps of the OL-induced spectrum (unless they are very close to edges of the gaps) feature a (tightly bound) shape, being essentially confined to a single cell of the OL. In the second bandgap, we also find antisymmetric tightly bound subfundamental solitons (SFSs), with zero at the midpoint. The SFSs are also confined to a single cell of the OL, but, unlike the FGSs, they are unstable.

The application of the adiabatic approximation introduced by Irish et al. [ Phys. Rev. B 72 195410 (2005)] for a single-qubit system is extended to the multiqubit case. For a two-qubit system, we identify three-state manifolds of close-lying dressed energy levels and obtain results for the dynamics of intramanifold transitions that are incompatible with results from the familiar regime of the RWA. We exhibit features of two-qubit dynamics that are different from the single-qubit case, including calculations of qubit-qubit entanglement. Both number state and coherent state preparations are considered, and we derive analytical formulas that simplify the interpretation of numerical calculations.

Similarly, how quantum optics reduces to wave optics has also been considered to be a very simple business. It is not so. As we show here the classical limit of quantum optics is a far more complicated issue; it is in fact dramatically more involved and it requires a complete revision of all our intuitions.

We apply this to two optomechanical cavities set-up within a Mach–Zhender interferometer driven by a single photon source. The conditional state of the mechanical modes in such a system becomes an entangled cat state for detection times resulting in maximum mechanical amplitude in phase space. Further we study the dynamics induced by a second photon pulse injected into an already conditioned optomechanical cavity, a quarter of a mechanical period after the ﬁrst photon has been detected. We illustrate how the optomechanical interaction resulting from the second photon can be strongly suppressed allowing conditional optomechanical routing of single photons with single photon control pulses.},

In the absence of nonlinearity these solutions are used to calculate the second order variances and hence the squeezing in pure and in mixed modes. The higher order quadrature squeezing and the amplitude squared squeezing of various field modes are also investigated where the squeezing in pure and in mixed modes are found to be suppressed. Moreover, the absence of a nonlinearity prohibits the higher order quadrature and higher ordered amplitude squeezing of the input coherent states. It is established that the mere coupling of two oscillators through a third one is unable to produce any squeezing effects of input coherent light, but the presence of a nonlinear interaction may provide squeezed states and other nonclassical phenomena.},

Phase transitions from ordinary fluorescence to super-radiant phase in three different models are investigated. First a model where the coupling z between the bosonic mode and the jth atom is via the pseudo-spin-operator â´j is studied. Second, we investigate the generalized Dicke model, introducing different coupling constants between the single mode bosonic-field and the environment, g1 and g2, for rotating and counter-rotating terms, respectively. Finally a modified version of the generalized Dicke model with intensity-dependent coupling in the rotating terms is considered. In the first model, for an arbitrary value for the coupling constant, the zero mode contributes in rendering the canonical entropy a negative quantity for low temperatures. For small coupling constants, the partition function is analytic for all temperatures.

The steady-state mean-ﬁeld equation of the optical mode is identical to the one for a Kerr medium, and thus we expect it to have the same characteristic behavior with a lower, a middle, and an upper branch. However, the presence of position ﬂuctuations of the mechanical resonator leads to a new feature: the upper branch will become unstable at sufﬁciently strong driving in certain parameter regimes. We identify the appropriate parameter regime for the upper branch to be stable, and we conﬁrm, by numerical investigation of the quantum steady state, that the mechanical mode indeed acts as a Kerr nonlinearity for the optical mode in the low-temperature limit. This equivalence of the optomechanical system and the Kerr medium will be important for future applications of cavity optomechanics in quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information science.},

A small electric dipole, delicately suspended in a circular waveguide, continuously rotates under the torque influence of an incident circularly polarized wave of low power. A component of the wave energy scattered from the dipole experiences a natural downshift in frequency equal to twice the dipole rotation frequency. This intrinsic change in wave energy completely accounts for the power extracted from the wave in turning the dipole against damping forces. The experiment is a macroscopic model of a rotational mechanism through which spectral shifts can arise in nature, and appears to be analogous to the rotational Raman effect with linear molecules. Since the interaction between wave and dipole is reversible, the energy (frequency) of an interacting circularly polarized wave is increased whenever the direction of rotation of the scattering dipole opposes the torque of the wave. Through this mechanism, energy can be transferred from one circularly polarized wave to a second of higher frequency but of less intensity. This corresponds to the generation of an anti-Stokes line.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a mechanism for a controlled generation of a pure Bell state with correlated atoms that involve two or zero excitations. The mechanism inhibits transitions into singly excited collective states of a two-atom system by shifting them from their unperturbed energies. The shift is accomplished by the dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms. The creation of the Bell state is found to be dependent on the relaxation of the atomic excitation. When the relaxation is not present or can be ignored, the state of the system evolves harmonically between a separable to the maximally entangled state.We follow the temporal evolution of the state and find that the concurrence can be different from zero only in the presence of the dipole-dipole interaction. Furthermore, in the limit of a large dipole-dipole interaction, the concurrence reduces to that predicted for an X state of the system. A general inequality is found which shows that the concurrence of an X-state system is a lower bound for the concurrence of the two-atom system. With the relaxation present, the general state of the system is a mixed state that under a strong dipole-dipole interaction reduces the system to an X-state form. We find that mixed states admit of lower level of entanglement, and the entanglement may occur over a finite range of time. A simple analytical expression is obtained for the steady-state concurrence which shows that there is a threshold value for the dipole-dipole interaction relative to the Rabi frequency of the driving field above which the atoms can be entangled over the entire time of the evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {We have studied quantum mechanically a system of several small identical Josephson junctions in a lossless single-mode cavity for different initial states, under conditions such that the system is at resonance. This system is analogous to a collection of identical atoms in a cavity, which is described under appropriate conditions by the Dicke model. We find that our system can be well approximated by a reduced Hamiltonian consisting of two levels per junction. The reduced Hamiltonian is similar to the Dicke Hamiltonian, but contains an additional term resembling a dipole-dipole interaction between the junctions. This extra term can Â¨ be understood as a natural consequence of degenerate second-order Lowdin perturbation theory. For typical, physically reasonable values of the junction-cavity coupling, we find that this perturbation treatment is an adequate way to include the junction energy levels beyond the lowest two. As in the Dicke model, we find that, when N junctions are present in the cavity, the junction-cavity interaction is enhanced by Í±N, with a corresponding decrease in the Rabi oscillation period. We find that this enhancement survives even if the junctions differ slightly from one another, as expected in a realistic system. Since coherence effects thus reduce the Rabi period, it may become smaller than the decoherence time due to dissipation, making these oscillations observable.

We found that the quantum states of the combined system are strongly entangled only at certain special values of the gate voltage across the junction, corresponding to a one- or two-photon absorption or emission process by the junction Cooper pairs. We also showed that at a gate voltage corresponding to the one-photon process, our results, obtained from exact diagonalization, agree well with those obtained from a reduced Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian2 which includes only two-junction states and two-photon states. In the present paper, we extend this work to several similar junctions placed in a resonant cavity within a radiation wavelength. Each junction is assumed to be voltage biased by an independent voltage source, but all bias voltages are assumed to be equal. As in the single-junction case, we solve for the eigenstates of this coupled system by direct diagonalization and compare the results to those obtained from a reduced Hamiltonian which includes only two energy levels per junction. A major goal of our work is to compare the junctioncavity interaction to that in a system first discussed by Dicke,3 consisting of an assembly of identical two-level atoms in a single-mode cavity. We find that, for typical values of our system parameters, the effects of the energy levels beyond the lowest two per junction are included adequately by a straightforward second-order perturbation theory. These higher-level effects manifest themselves as an additional effective interaction between the junctions beyond the Dicke Hamiltonian which has the form of a dipole-dipole coupling. Before proceeding further, we note some distinctions between the system considered here and another system which},

  Abstract                 = {We calmlate the asymptotic quantum state oIa driven cavity mode interacting with a two-state atom when the dipole coupling constant is much larger than the atomic and cavity linewidths. We show that a novel symmetry breaking transition occurs as the strength of the driving field is increased. Although the driving field, the cavity mode, and the atom are all resonant, above the transition threshold the intracavity field shows a bimodality in phase. The bimodality results lrom an intensity-dependent detuning between the driving field and the transition frequencies of the composite atom-cavity-mode ‘molecule.’ Well above the transition threshold the driven cavity mode plus atom behaves as a driven harmonic oscillator with randomly switched deroning; the detuning (and hence the phase of the intracavity field) changes sign each time the atom makes a spontaneous transition between dressed states.},

The Stark effect shifts the energy levels of the atoms which tunes the energy exchange into resonance at specific values of the electric field (FÂ¨orster resonances). We excite rubidium atoms to Rydberg states by focusing either a 480 nm beam from a tunable dye laser or a pair of diode lasers into a magneto-optical trap. The trap lies at the center of a configuration of electrodes. We scan the electric field by controlling the voltage on the electrodes while measuring the fraction of atoms that interact. Dipole-dipole interaction spectra are presented for initially excited rubidium nd states for n = 31 to 46 and for four different pairs of initially excited rubidium ns states. We also present the dipole-dipole interaction spectra for individual rubidium 32d (j,mj ) fine structure levels that have been selectively excited. The data are compared to calculated spectra.},

Contrary to previous investigations of the same model in the dissipative regime by using the standard Lindblad quantum optical master equation in a strong-coupling regime, the atom-ﬁeld steady states are found to be cavity decay rate independent and have a very simple structure determined solely by the overlap of initial atomic state with the subradiant state which is valid for all coupling regimes. Non-RWA dynamics are found to have remarkable effects on the steady state quantum discord and entanglement that cannot be achieved under RWA conditions, for instance, they can induce steady state entanglement even for the initial states that have no overlap with the subradiant state. Moreover, the non-RWA dynamics are found to reverse the initial state dependence of steady state entanglement and quantum discord contrary to the RWA case.},

We demonstrate that the method is suitable for fermionic as well as bosonic baths. Comparisons with exact analytical results for the charge relaxation in the resonant-level model and for dephasing in the spin-boson model establish the accuracy of the method. The real-time dynamics of a single spin coupled to each type of bath is investigated. We use the TD-NRG to calculate the spin relaxation and spin precession of a single Kondo impurity. The short- and long-time dynamics are studied as a function of temperature in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. The short-time dynamics agrees very well with analytical results obtained at second order in the exchange coupling J. In the ferromagnetic regime, the transient spin decay is described by the scaling variable x = 2â³FJTTt. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the long-time decay is governed for T Ï½ TK by the Kondo time scale 1 / TK. Here â³F is the conduction-electron density of states, TK is the Kondo temperature, and JT is the effective exchange coupling at temperature T. Results for spin precession are obtained by rotating the external magnetic field from the x axis to the z axis.},

It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state. A calculation including degenerate d orbitals and d-d exchange shows that the orbital angular momentum can be quenched, even when localized spin moments exist, and even on an isolated magnetic atom, by kinetic energy effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The Jackiw-Rebbi model describes a one-dimensional Dirac field coupled to a soliton field and can be equivalently thought of as a model describing a Dirac field with a spatially dependent mass term. Neglecting the dynamics of the soliton field, a kink in the background soliton profile yields a topologically protected zero-energy mode for the field, which in turn leads to charge fractionalisation. We show here that the model, in the first quantised form, can be realised in a driven slow-light setup, where photons mimic the Dirac field and the soliton field can be implemented–and tuned–by adjusting optical parameters such as the atom-photon detuning. Furthermore, we discuss how the existence of the zero-mode and its topological stability can be probed naturally by studying the transmission spectrum. We conclude by analysing the robustness of our approach against possible experimental errors in engineering the Jackiw-Rebbi Hamiltonian in this optical setup.},

Utilizing the connection between strongly interacting bosonic and fermionic systems, we then show how spin-charge separation could be observed by probing the correlations in the polaritons. This is performed by first mapping the polaritons to propagating photon pulses and then measuring the effective photonic spin and charge densities and velocities by analyzing the correlations in the emitted photon spectrum. The necessary regime of interactions is achievable with current quantum-optical technology.},

We demonstrate how a Mott-insulator phase of atom-photon excitations polaritons can arise in an array of individually addressable coupled electromagnetic cavities when each of these cavities is coupled resonantly to a single two-level system atom, quantum dot, or Cooper pair. This Mott phase is characterized by the same integral number of net polaritonic excitations with photon blockade providing the required repulsion between the excitations in each site. Detuning the atomic and photonic frequencies suppresses this effect and induces a transition to a photonic superfluid. Finally, on resonance the system can straightforwardly simulate the dynamics of many-body spin systems.},

In contrast to the orbital one, experimental observation of the spin flow seems problematic because it is converted into an orbital flow upon tight focusing of the beam, usually applied for energy flow detection by means of the mechanical action upon probe particles. We propose a two-beam interference technique that results in an appreciable level of spin flow in moderately focused beams and detection of the orbital motion of probe particles within a field where the transverse energy circulation is associated exclusively with the spin flow. This result can be treated as the first demonstration of mechanical action of the spin flow of a light field.},

In this paper, the complex-source/sink solution for the nonparaxial BG beam is expressed as a superposition of nonparaxial elegant LaguerreâGaussian beams. This provides a direct way to write the explicit expression for a tightly focused BG beam that is an exact solution of the Helmholtz equation. It reduces correctly to the paraxial BG beam, the nonparaxial Gaussian beam, and the Bessel beam in the appropriate limits. The analytical expression can be used to calculate the field of a BG beam near its waist, and it may be useful in investigating the features of BG beams under tight focusing conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantum emitter efficiently coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide constitutes a promising system for the realization of single-photon transistors, quantum-logic gates based on giant single-photon nonlinearities, and high bit-rate deterministic single-photon sources. The key figure of merit for such devices is the β factor, which is the probability for an emitted single photon to be channeled into a desired waveguide mode. We report on the experimental achievement of β=98.43%±0.04% for a quantum dot coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide, corresponding to a single-emitter cooperativity of η=62.7±1.5. This constitutes a nearly ideal photon-matter interface where the quantum dot acts effectively as a 1D “artificial” atom, since it interacts almost exclusively with just a single propagating optical mode. The β factor is found to be remarkably robust to variations in position and emission wavelength of the quantum dots. Our work demonstrates the extraordinary potential of photonic crystal waveguides for highly efficient single-photon generation and on-chip photon-photon interaction.},

The derivation of the properties of the atomic coherent states is made easier by the use of a powerful disentangling theorem for exponential angular momentum operators. A complete labeling of the atomic states is developed and many of their properties are studied. In particular it is shown that the atomic coherent states are the quantum analogs of classical dipoles, and that they can be produced by classical fields.},

Some of the important matrix elements were further optimized using the experimental results available for the lifetimes and static polarizabilities of atomic states. “Magic wavelengths” are determined from the differential Stark shifts and results for the linearly polarized light are compared with the previously available results. The possible scope of facilitating state-insensitive optical trapping schemes using the magic wavelengths for circularly polarized light is discussed.

The destruction of the adiabatic invariance is due to the change of type of the particle trajectory: particles can drift along the boundary reflecting from it or rotate around the magnetic field at some distance from the boundary without collisions with it. Trajectories of these two types are demarcated in the phase space by a separatrix. Crossings of the separatrix result in jumps of the adiabatic invariant. We derive an asymptotic formula for such a jump and demonstrate that an accumulation of these jumps leads to the destruction of the adiabatic invariance.}

The coupling strength can thus be maximized by ﬁlling the entire cavity volume with an ensemble of interacting dipoles. In this work this is achieved by inserting a highly doped semiconductor layer in a subwavelength plasmonic resonator. In our system the ultra-strong light–matter coupling occurs between a collective electronic excitation and the cavity photon. The measured coupling strength is 73% of the matter excitation energy, the highest ever reported for a light–matter coupled system at room temperature. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that such an ultra-strong interaction modiﬁes the optical properties on a very wide spectral range (20–250meV), and results in the appearance of a photonic gap of 38 meV, independently of the light polarization and angle of incidence. Light–matter ultra-strong coupling can thus be exploited to conceive metasurfaces with an engineered reﬂectivity band.},

  Abstract                 = {We study dynamical recurrences of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical crystal subject to a periodic external driving force. The recurrence behavior of the condensate is analyzed as a function of time close to nonlinear resonances occurring in the classical counterpart. Our mathematical formalism for the recurrence time scales is presented as delicate recurrences, which take place, for instance, when the lattice is perturbed weakly and robust recurrences, which may manifest themselves for a sufﬁciently strong external driving force. The analysis not only is valid for a dilute condensate, but also is applicable for the strongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided; the external modulation causes no signiﬁcant change in the density proﬁle of the condensate. We explain the parametric dependence of the dynamical recurrence times, which can easily be realized in laboratory experiments. In addition, we ﬁnd good agreement between the obtained analytical results and the numerical calculations.}

  Abstract                 = {We propose an experiment to create and verify entanglement between remote mechanical objects by use of an optomechanical interferometer. Two optical cavities, each coupled to a separate mechanical oscillator, are coherently driven such that the oscillators are laser cooled to the quantum regime. The entanglement is induced by optical measurement and comes about by combining the output from the two cavities to erase which-path information. It can be verified through measurements of degrees of secondorder coherence of the optical output field. The experiment is feasible in the regime of weak optomechanical coupling. Realistic parameters for the membrane-in-the-middle geometry suggest entangled state lifetimes on the order of milliseconds.},

For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice1â5 can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models6. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-byatom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom7â9. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Herewe present a quantum gas âmicroscopeâ that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system inwhich atoms of amacroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantuminformation systems based on ultracold atoms.},

The generalized decomposition formulas for exponential functions of the generators of su(2) and su(1,1) Lie algebras are derived and their expectation values are calculated for typical states in quantum optics. The general procedure for using Lie algebras in the Liouville space to treat quantum optical processes is given in terms of generalized decomposition formulas and their use is demonstrated by calculating the absorption line shape and photon echo signal in a localized electron-phonon system. It is also shown that the photon-counting probability can be calculated by using the su(1,1) Lie algebra and that the electron-counting probability can be calculated by using the su(2) Lie algebra. The su(1,1) Lie algebra is also used to investigate a quantum-nondemolition measurement of photon number in the four-wave-mixing model.},

In the Liouville space, the time-evolution equation for the state vector of a system is solved algebraically by using the decomposition formulas of SU( 1,l) Lie algebra and the thermal state condition of therm0 field dynamics. The presented formulation is used for investigating a dissipative nonlinear oscillator, the quantum mechanical model of phase modulation, and the photon echo in the localized electron-phonon system.

In order to control diffraction, the study of structured waves has become decisive. Here, we present a specific class of nondiffracting spatially accelerating solutions of the Maxwell equations: the Weber waves. These nonparaxial waves propagate along parabolic trajectories while approximately preserving their shape. They are expressed in an analytic closed form and naturally separate in forward and backward propagation. We show that the Weber waves are self-healing, can form periodic breather waves and have a well-defined conserved quantity: the parabolic momentum. We find that our Weber waves for moderate to large values of the parabolic momenta can be described by a modulated Airy function. Because the Weber waves are exact time-harmonic solutions of the wave equation, they have implications for many linear wave systems in nature, ranging from acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic waves to surface waves in fluids and membranes.},

We have found that their dynamics does not depend on the ratio of these time scales but is instead determined crucially by the difference in photon numbers of the two modes. This is in stark contrast to the previously studied harmonic-oscillator coherent states and can be attributed to the different nature of the underlying algebra. We provide analytical results for their revival and fractional revival along with numerical plots of the autocorrelation function and the quadrature distribution and demonstrate the formation of Schrodinger cats. The results are extremely sensitive to the Casimir invariant and the complex parameters characterizing SU(1,1) coherent states.},

However, for light, a typical massless wave system, the situation is less versatile. Photons are well-known to exhibit intrinsic angular momentum which is longitudinal only: the spin angular momentum defining the polarization and the orbital angular momentum associated with a spiraling phase front. Here we show that it is possible to generate a novel state of the light field that contains purely transverse angular momentum, the analogue of a spinning mechanical wheel. We realize this state by tight focusing of a polarization tailored light beam and measure it using an optical nano-probing technique. Such a novel state of the light field can find applications in optical tweezers and spanners where it allows for additional rotational degree of freedom not achievable in single-beam configurations so far.},

On the other hand, in the PT-symmetric coupler, the focusing nonlinearity promotes the blow-up of stationary light beams. The purpose of this study is to compare the nonlinear dynamics and explain the opposite effect of the same nonlinearity in the two systems. We show that, while the blow-up regimes are stable in the PT-symmetric pair of waveguides, they are unstable and hence cannot be observed in the AC dimer.},

  Abstract                 = {A ${\mathcal{P}}{\mathcal{T}}$-symmetric nonlinear Schrödinger dimer is a two-site discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with one site losing and the other one gaining energy at the same rate. In this paper, two four-parameter families of cubic ${\mathcal{P}}{\mathcal{T}}$-symmetric dimers are constructed as gain–loss extensions of their conservative, Hamiltonian, counterparts. We prove that all these damped-driven equations define completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. The second aim of our study is to identify nonlinearities that give rise to the spontaneous ${\mathcal{P}}{\mathcal{T}}$-symmetry restoration. When the symmetry of the underlying linear dimer is broken and an unstable small perturbation starts to grow, the nonlinear coupling of the required type will divert an increasingly large percentage of energy from the gaining to the losing site. As a result, the exponential growth will be saturated and all trajectories remain trapped in a finite part of the phase space regardless of the value of the gain–loss coefficient.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, $\hbar \omega$. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average $(\hbar \omega)^2$, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5 kT_{c} at T=0 K to zero at T_{c}. Tables of matrix elements of a single -particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transitions probabilities, are given.},

(ii) The angular-momentum ﬂux for a light beam about its axis (or propagation direction) can be separated into spin and orbital parts. This separation is gauge invariant and does not rely on the paraxial approximation. (iii) Angular-momentum ﬂux can describe the propagation of angular momentum in other geometries, but the identiﬁcation of spin and orbital parts is then more problematic. We calculate the ﬂux for a component of angular momentum that is perpendicular to the axis of a light beam and for the ﬁeld associated with an electric dipole.

These rules apply to all bulk media including the metamaterials designed to provide negative refractive indices.

However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation.},

The method is illustrated in the case of the 2 + 1 Lorentz group. All linear representations of this group, their various realizations in Hilbert space as well as the matrix elements of finite transformations have been found.

We first derive the general form of the Hamiltonian describing the tripartite intensity-dependent atom-field-mirror coupling due to the presence of the cavity mode structure.We then restrict our treatment to the first vibrational sideband of the mechanical resonator and derive a tripartite atom-field-mirror Hamiltonian.We showthatwhen the optical cavity is intensely driven, one can generate bipartite entanglement between any pair in the tripartite system and that, due to entanglement sharing, atom-mirror entanglement is efficiently generated at the expense of optical-mechanical and optical-atom entanglement. We also find that in such a system, when the Lamb-Dicke parameter is large enough, one can simultaneously observe the normal mode splitting into three modes.},

By examining the nonclassical properties of the generated state of the membrane, including the quadrature squeezing and the sub-Poissonian statistics, we find that by varying the LambâDicke parameter and the membraneâs reflectivity one can effectively control those properties. In addition, the scheme offers the possibility of generating various types of the so-called nonlinear multicomponent SchrÂ¨odinger cat states of the membrane.

This model is closely related to a more general disordered system that has been introduced in conjunction with the integer quantum Hall transition. After disorder averaging, the interaction can be written as a marginal osp(2|2) current–current perturbation. The osp(2|2) current–current model in turn can be viewed as the fully renormalized version of an osp(2|2)(1) Toda-type system (at the marginal point). We build nonlocal charges for the Toda system satisfying the Uq [osp(2|2)(1)] quantum superalgebra. The corresponding quantum group symmetry is used to construct a Toda S-matrix for the vector representation. We argue that in the marginal (or rational) limit, this S-matrix gives the exact (Yangian symmetric) physical S-matrix for the fundamental “solitons” of the osp(2|2) current–current model.}

The Dicke model is an example of a quantum collective behavior which shows superradiant quantum phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit. Results obtained employing two different bases are compared. Both of them use the pseudospin basis to describe the atomic states. For the photon states we use in one case Fock states, while in the other case we use a basis built over a particular coherent state, associated to each atomic state. It is shown that, when the number of atoms increases, the description of the ground state of the system in the superradiant phase requires an equivalent number of photons to be included. This imposes a strong limit to the states that can be calculated using Fock states, while the dimensionality needed to obtain convergent results in the other basis decreases when the atomic number increases, allowing calculations that are very difﬁcult in the Fock basis. Naturally, it reduces also the computing time, economizing computing resources. We show results for the energy, the photon number and the number of excited atoms, for the ground and the ﬁrst excited state.},

Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPT) are found analyzing the density of states in the semiclassical limit and comparing it with numerical results for the quantum case in large Hilbert spaces, taking advantage of efficient methods recently developed. Two different ESQPTs are identified in both models, which are signaled as singularities in the semiclassical density of states; one static ESQPT occurs for any coupling, whereas a dynamic ESQPT is observed only in the superradiant phase. The role of the unstable fixed points of the Hamiltonian semiclassical flux in the occurrence of the ESQPTs is discussed and determined. Numerical evidence is provided that shows that the semiclassical results describe very well the tendency of the quantum energy spectrum for any coupling in both models. Therefore, the semiclassical density of states can be used to study the statistical properties of the fluctuation in the spectra, a study that is presented in a companion paper.},

The present contribution extends the analysis presented in the previous paper by focusing on the statistical properties of the quantum fluctuations in the energy spectrum and their relation with the excited-state quantum phase transitions. These properties are compared with the dynamics observed in the semiclassical versions of the models. The presence of chaos for different energies and coupling constants is exhibited, employing Poincaré sections and Peres lattices in the classical and quantum versions, respectively. A clear correspondence between the classical and quantum result is found for systems containing between N=80 and 200 atoms. A measure of the Wigner character of the energy spectrum for different couplings and energy intervals is also presented employing the statistical Anderson-Darling test. It is found that in the Dicke model, for any coupling, a low-energy regime with regular states is always present. The richness of the onset of chaos is discussed both for finite quantum systems and for the semiclassical limit, which is exact when the number of atoms in the system tends to infinite.},

  Abstract                 = {A phase transition describes the sudden change of state of a physical system, such as melting or freezing. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter-light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases.},

  Abstract                 = {A semiclassical model consisting of two noninteracting waveguide arrays along with three side-coupled waveguides is presented to demonstrate the optical analogue of double Fano resonance. The photonic system is configured so that it causes simultaneous cross coupling between two decay channels via one array and another two decay channels via the other array. Owing to the two individual interference effects, the decay-rate profile for the waveguide coupled directly to the continuum exhibits two asymmetric peaks, or dips, or a combination of one peak and one dip in the vicinity of the frequency mismatches. As far as the distribution of optical field amplitudes in the side-coupled waveguides is concerned, the present model also demonstrates the features of optical trapping (optical analogue of coherent population trapping) in side-coupled waveguides under certain symmetric parametric conditions.}

The presence of one extra degree of freedom in the Hilbert space of particles, which is not used in encoding, allows one to achieve perfect transfer even in a uniform chain through a repeated measurement procedure with consecutive single site measurements. Apart from the first iteration, for which the time of evolution grows linearly with the size of the chain, in all other iterations, the evolution times are short and do not scale with the length. The success probability of the mechanism grows with the number of repetitions and practically after a few iterations the transfer is accomplished with a high probability.},

More importantly, the diffraction analogy facilitates the development of an intuitive understanding of the role that the initial phase plays in free-particle wave packet evolution. This article considers some of the effects of the initial phase function on the subsequent evolution of free-particle wave packets in the position representation. These considerations reinforce the idea that the classical mechanics limit embodied in the correspondence principle and formalized in the Ehrenfest theorem is necessarily an incomplete representation of quantum behavior.},

In this paper, we show how this simpliﬁcation, which leads to the standard quantum optics master equation, is at the root of unphysical effects. Including qubit relaxation and dephasing, and cavity relaxation, we derive a master equation that takes into account the qubit-resonator coupling. Special attention is given to the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the failure of the quantum optical master equation is manifest. In this situation, our model predicts an asymmetry in the vacuum Rabi splitting that could be used to probe dephasing noise at unexplored frequencies. We also show how ﬂuctuations in the qubit frequency can cause sideband transitions, squeezing, and Casimir-like photon generation.},

In this note that idea will be formulated mathematically and shown to be incompatible with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. It is the requirement of locality, or more precisely that the result of a mesurement on one system be unaffected by operations on a distant system with which it has interacted in te past, that creates the essential difficulty. There have been attempts to show that even without such a separability or locality requirement no hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible. These attempts have been exacmined elsewhere and found wanting. Moreover, a hidden variable interpretation of elementary quantum theory has been explicitly constructed. That particular interpretation has indeed a grossly nonlocal structure.

It has been shown previously that quasiseparable structure (essentially low-rank blocks up to but excluding the main diagonal) is particularly useful in providing such recurrence relations characterizations. Some classical classes of matrices with quasiseparable structure include tridiagonal (related to real orthogonal polynomials) and banded matrices, unitary Hessenberg matrices (related to Szeg¨ polynomials), and semiseparable o matrices, as well as others. Hence working with the class of quasiseparable matrices provides new results which generalize and unify known results. Previous work has focused on characterizing (H, 1)-quasiseparable matrices, matrices with order- one quasiseparable structure that are also upper Hessenberg. This restriction permits a useful bijection between the sets of matrices and systems of polynomials, and thus the results derived are complete characterizations. In this paper, the authors introduce the concept of a twist transformation, and use them to explain the relationship between (H, 1)-quasiseparable matrices and the subclass of (1, 1)-quasiseparable matrices (without the upper Hessenberg restriction) which are related to the same systems of polynomials. These results explain the discoveries of Cantero, Fiedler, Kimura, Moral and Vel´zquez of five-diagonal matrices related to Horner and Szeg¨ polynomials in a o the context of quasiseparable matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory is developed for the interaction of coherent electromagnetic (EM) radiation with a free electron gas and for the inAuence of the plasma on the photon statistics of the radiation field. Two important possibilities for generating squeezed states are shown: Squeezed states can be generated by the interaction of a one-mode laser with a plasma in a cavity; squeezed states can be generated by transmitting coherent radiation through the plasma. The maximal squeezing of the radiation obtained in the latter case is equal to the reciprocal of the dielectric constant of the plasma. Inside the plasma the EM field is represented by quasiphotons. Their dispersion relations are derived by using Bogoliubov transformations together with a self-consistency requirement for the motion of the electrons interacting with these quasiphotons. The squeezing processes are found to be strong when the frequency of the radiation is a little above the plasma frequency. By adding a constant magnetic field in the direction of propagation of the EM wave different amounts of squeezing are obtained for right- and left-circularly polarized EM waves.},

  Abstract                 = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose +complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space–time reflection ( \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} ) symmetry. If H has an unbroken \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=\hat{p}^2+\rmi\hat{x}^3 and H=\hat{p}^2-\hat{x}^4 . Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! Does a \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator \mathcal{C} . In terms of \mathcal{C} , one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm 'ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric. The \mathcal{C} operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.},

  Abstract                 = {In most introductory courses on quantum mechanics one is taught that the Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes H= H, where the symbol denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is,transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space – time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian PT -symmetric quantum theories.},

New quantum effects are discussed concerning the time dependence of the photon number and of its fluctuations, assuming that at t=0 one of the modes is coherent and the other is empty . The field dynamics are dominated by oscillatory net exchanges of a large number of photons between the two modes, displaying amplitude decay . Over a longer time scale, revivals and collapses in the field populations take place . The time scales of these phenomena are much larger than those of the atomic Rabi oscillations decay . Moreover, the system attains a highly non-classical regime in which the field intensity in each mode is subjected to strong fluctuations even for a large initial number of photons in the coherent mode. Various correlations between atomic and field dynamics are pointed out, and the physical origin of the new quantum effects is briefly discussed . Finally, using our fully quantized calculations, we comment on the validity of the atomic homodyne detection proposed by Wilkens and Meystre .},

The Mollow-transformed Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian has two atom-ﬁeld terms, one corresponding to a classical ﬁeld and the other to a quantized ﬁeld driving the atomic transition. As such it maps onto the complementary problem of an atom in an optical cavity, whose ﬁeld is initially in the vacuum state, driven by an external classical ﬁeld. Both problems have the same atomic-state dynamics. It is shown that the revivals can be associated with two distinct properties of the quantized ﬁeld of the transformed Hamiltonian. Revivals occurring at even (odd) multiples of the revival time are correlated with ﬁeld states that are close to the initial ﬁeld state and for which the average energy in the ﬁeld is a minimum (maximum). Using semiclassical dressed states, we are able to map the problem for the ﬁeld states onto one involving two uncoupled oscillators driven by off-resonant ﬁelds, provided effects related to dispersion are neglected. Analytic expressions for the photon number distribution of the transformed cavity ﬁeld, including dispersion, are obtained for the even revival times.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we construct photon-added f -deformed coherent states (PAf -DCSs) for nonlinear bosonic fields by discussing Klauder’s minimal set of conditions required to obtain coherent states. Using this set of nonlinear states, we propose a very useful scheme for generating the maximal amount of entanglement via unitary beam splitters for different strength regimes of the input field a, deformation q and excitation number m. Therefore, the possibility to create highly entangled states and to control the entanglement is proposed. Moreover, the condition for a maximal and separable output beam state is obtained. Finally, we examine the statistical properties of the PAf -DCSs through the Mandel parameter and exploit a connection between this quantity and the behavior variation of the output state entanglement. Our result may open new perspectives in different tasks of quantum information processing.},

The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic ﬁelds, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by inﬁnitely many driving ﬁelds, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving ﬁelds have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reﬂectionless potentials.},

In this article a series of wave problems is treated descriptively. cylindrical waves are examined first bogh on account of their conceptual simplicity and because the exact wave functions are fully understood. Next the rainbow and flowry scattering of plane waves from spheres is considered. The third example, somewhat out of character with the others but showing the wide applicability of techniques of uniform approximation, concerns the calculation of scattering lengths, and finally a brief account of the classical problems of diffraction from edges and curved surfaces is given.},

The acceleration of the packet (which does not violate Ehrenfest’s theorem) is related to the curvature of the caustic (envelope) of the family of world lines in spacetime. When a spatially uniform force F (t) acts the Airy packet continues to preserve its integrity. We exhibit the solution of Schrödinger’s equation for general F (t) and discuss the motion for some special forms of F (t).},

For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore, it prevents bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping, and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that the quantum mechanical dynamics of the mirror become easier to observe. These improvements are expected to bring the task of achieving and detecting ground state occupation for the mirror closer to completion.},

An alternative version of the uncertainty relation derived in this paper is closer in spirit to the original Heisenberg relation because it employs the analog of the position operator for the photon-the center of the energy operator. The noncommutativity of the components of the center of the energy operator results in the increase of the bound 3¯ /2 in the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation in three dimensions. This difference diminishes with the h increase of the photon energy. In the infinite-momentum frame, the lower bound in the Heisenberg uncertainty relations for photons is the same as in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. A similar uncertainty relation is also derived for coherent photon beams. This relation has direct experimental consequences since it gives a precise relationship between the spectral composition of the laser beam and the minimal focal volume.},

The counterpart of this enhanced dynamics, subradiance, is a destructive interference effect leading to the partial trapping of light in the system. In contrast to the robust superradiance, subradiant states are fragile, and spurious decoherence phenomena hitherto obstructed the observation of such metastable states. We show that a dilute cloud of cold atoms is an ideal system to look for subradiance in free space and study various mechanisms to control this subradiance.},

  Abstract                 = {While a nonzero spontaneous magnetization m cannot exist in a d=2 Heisenberg spin system, it is possible that a phase transition associated with a divergent susceptibility occurs at the Stanley-Kaplan temperature TcSK. The crossover from this special isotropic case to the anisotropic (Ising) behavior is studied using a Monte Carlo technique. The classical model with Hamiltonian H=-J$\Sigma$[(1-$\Delta$)(SixSjx+SiySjy)+SizSjz] on NÃN square lattices with periodic boundary conditions is investigated for Nâ¤100 and $\Delta$ varying from 0.005 to 1. The spontaneous magnetization m, energy, specific heat, longitudinal and transverse susceptibilities, and the self-correlation are determined over a wide temperature range. For weak anisotropy dm/dT decreases nonmonotonically with increasing temperature and deviations from simple spin-wave theory occur at surprisingly low temperatures. Transition temperatures Tc($\Delta$) exceed the isotropic value TcSK predicted by series expansions although the values would also be consistent with TcSK=0 if Tc($\Delta$)â|ln(1/$\Delta$)|-1. The asymptotic critical exponent for the order parameter is $\beta$=1/8 for all $\Delta$. The susceptibility data show crossover from $\gamma$=1.75 near Tc($\Delta$) to higher values farther from Tc($\Delta$). It is shown that finite-size rounding may lead to erroneously large estimates for $\beta$ and erroneously small estimates for $\gamma$. These effects may invalidate some conclusions drawn from experiments on planar systems, too. Accepting the series estimate kBTcSK/J=0.588 we find that the data are consistent with Tc($\Delta$)-TcSKâ$\Delta$1/$\phi$ with phiâ4. Assuming power-law behavior we show that our data obey crossover scaling with two-dimensional Heisenberg exponents $\gamma$Hâ3, $\alpha$Hâ-2 in the isotropic limit. The data are also consistent with scaling theory based on the assumption of singularities which are stronger than any power law.},

  Abstract                 = {At low temperatures, sufficiently small metallic1 and semiconductor2 devices exhibit the 'Coulomb blockade' effect, in which charge transport through the device occurs on an electron-byelectron basis3. For example, a single electron on a metallic island can block the flow of another electron if the charging energy of the island greatly exceeds the thermal energy. The analogous effect of 'photon blockade' has been proposed for the transport of light through an optical system; this involves photon-photon interactions in a nonlinear optical cavity4-13. Here we report observations of photon blockade for the light transmitted by an optical cavity containing one trapped atom, in the regime of strong atom- cavity coupling14. Excitation of the atom-cavity system by a first photon blocks the transmission of a second photon, thereby converting an incident poissonian stream of photons into a subpoissonian, anti-bunched stream. This is confirmed by measurements of the photon statistics of the transmitted field. Our observations of photon blockade represent an advance over traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics, into a regime with dynamical processes involving atoms and photons taken one-by-one.},

They showed that N00N states for arbitrary photon number N could be produced by this procedure. Afek et al. [Science 328, 879 (2010)] have implemented the Hofmann–Ono proposal in the laboratory. In this paper, we show that, for a given coherent state amplitude and a given squeezing parameter, the mixing of coherent states and photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum states at the first beam splitter of an interferometer leads to improved phase-shift measurement sensitivity when using the photon-number detection technique on one of the output beams of the device. We also show that the phase-shift measurements will also be super-resolved to a greater degree than is possible by mixing coherent and squeezed vacuum light of the same field parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {On the level of single atoms and photons, the coupling between atoms and the electromagnetic field is typically very weak. By using a cavity to confine the field, the strength of this interaction can be increased by many orders of magnitude, to a point where it dominates over any dissipative process. This strong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics1,2 has been reached for real atoms in optical cavities3 , and for artificial atoms in circuit quantum electrodynamics4 and quantum dot systems5,6 . A signature of strong coupling is the splitting of the cavity transmission peak into a pair of resolvable peaks when a single resonant atom is placed inside the cavity, an effect known as vacuum Rabi splitting. The circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture is ideally suited for going beyond this linear-response effect. Here, we show that increasing the drive power results in two unique nonlinear features in the transmitted heterodyne signal: the supersplitting of each vacuum Rabi peak into a doublet and the â appearance of extra peaks with the characteristic n spacing of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder. These findings constitute direct evidence for the coupling between the quantized microwave field and the anharmonic spectrum of a superconducting qubit acting as an artificial atom.},

  Abstract                 = {Approximate resolution of linear systems of differential equations with varying coefficients is a recurrent problem, shared by a number of scientific and engineering areas, ranging from Quantum Mechanics to Control Theory. When formulated in operator or matrix form, the Magnus expansion furnishes an elegant setting to build up approximate exponential representations of the solution of the system. It provides a power series expansion for the corresponding exponent and is sometimes referred to as Time-Dependent Exponential Perturbation Theory. Every Magnus approximant corresponds in Perturbation Theory to a partial re-summation of infinite terms with the important additional property of preserving, at any order, certain symmetries of the exact solution. The goal of this review is threefold. First, to collect a number of developments scattered through half a century of scientific literature on Magnus expansion. They concern the methods for the generation of terms in the expansion, estimates of the radius of convergence of the series, generalizations and related non-perturbative expansions. Second, to provide a bridge with its implementation as generator of especial purpose numerical integration methods, a field of intense activity during the last decade. Third, to illustrate with examples the kind of results one can expect from Magnus expansion, in comparison with those from both perturbative schemes and standard numerical integrators.Webuttress this issue with a revision of the wide range of physical applications found by Magnus expansion in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {- A single two-level atom, with quantized centre-of-mass motion, is constrained to move in a one-dimensional harmonic potential, while interacting with a single-mode classical travelling light field. When the atoms’s centre-of-mass motion is in a coherent state, we show that the atomic inversion exhibits collapses and revivals. Whereas in the Jaynes-Cummings model this behaviour occurs due to the discrete nature of the light field, in our case the behaviour is due to the discrete nature of the vibrational trap states. The Q-function for the external motion is also calculated and shown to break into two peaks in the collapse region. Finally the parameter ranges under which the collapses and revivals can be observed are discussed, as well as the possibility of an experiment.},

As one prominent instance, we introduce the class of sixfold nondiffracting beams, offering four entirely different transverse intensity distributions: in detail, the hexagonal, kagome, and honeycomb pattern, as well as a hexagonal vortex beam. We further extend our considerations to quasiperiodic structures and show the changeover to Bessel beams. In addition, we introduce a highly flexible implementation of the experimental analog of DNBs, namely discrete pseudo-nondiffracting beams, and present locally resolved intensity and phase measurements, which underline the nondiffracting character of the generated wave fields.},

However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of withinconflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency18-20, is robust to many generalizations21, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism10 and ecology13-17,22,23. Its similarity to financial market models24-26 provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.},

Imposing (mass-dependent) periodic boundary conditions in time on the associated quantum-mechanical plane waves which represent the Schwarzschild system in the period just before or during the formation of a black hole yields an energy spectrum of the hole which realizes the old Bekenstein postulate that the quanta of the horizon $A_{ D- 2}$ are multiples of a basic area quantum. In the present paper it is shown that the phase space of such Schwarzschild black holes in $D$ space-time dimensions is symplectomorphic to a symplectic manifold S with the symplectic form $d \and dp$. As the action of the group $SO^{\uparrow} (1,2)$ on that manifold is transitive, effective and Hamiltonian, it can be used for a group theoretical quantization of the system. The area operator p for the horizon corresponds to the generator of the compact subgroup SO(2) and becomes quantized accordingly: The positive discrete series of the irreducible unitary representations of the group $SO^{\uparrow}(1,2)$ yields an (horizon) area spectrum $\approx (k+ n)$, where $ k= 1,2, \ldots $, characterizes the representation and $n=0,1,2, \ldots$ , the number of area quanta. If one employs the unitary representations of the universal covering group of $SO^{\uparrow}(1,2)$, the number k can take any fixed positive real value ($\theta$ parameter). The unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide concrete Hilbert spaces for quantum Schwarzschild black holes.},

In particular, we study superfluorescence, which is defined as the cooperative spontaneous emission, i,e., radiation rate proportional to N, from an atomic system initially excited with zero macroscopic dipole moment and a uniform population difference between the excited and the fundamental states. The atomic system is described by. means of collective dipole operators. A fundamental justification is given for the existence of damped "quasimodes" of the mirrorless active volume. The damping of such modes is simply due to the propagation of the Maxwell field, which escapes from the active volume. A general atom-field master equation is derived for the system atoms plus field inside the active volume, described, respectively, in terms of collective dipole operators and quasimode operators. An important feature of this equation is that inhomogeneous broadening simply appears via a time-dependent atom-field coupling constant. In this paper we give a semiclassical treatment of such a master equation. For a pencil-shaped geometry of the active volume, generalized Maxwell-Bloch equations are derived for the envelopes of the radiation inside the active volume and polarization. Such equations take into account the two directions of propagation of the radiation and the inhomogeneous broadening.},

We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected cavities.},

Despite the fact that a mixture of Schrödinger cat states is produced during the evolution (due to the fact that the macroscopic mirror starts off in a thermal state), this setup allows us to systematically probe the rules by which a superposition of spatially separated states of a macroscopic object decoheres. The parameter regime required to test environment-induced decoherence models is found to be close to those currently realizable, while that required to detect gravitationally induced collapse is well beyond current technology.}

First we consider state preparation of the cavity field. The system dynamics will prepare a single mode of the cavity field in a multicomponent Schrödinger-cat state, in a similar manner to that in a Kerr medium. In addition, when two or more cavity modes interact with the mirror, they can be prepared in an entangled state, which may be regarded as a multimode generalization of the even and odd coherent states. We show also that near-number states of a single mode may be prepared by performing a measurement of the position of the mirror. Second we consider state preparation of the mirror and show that this macroscopic object may be placed in a Schrödinger-cat-like state by a quadrature measurement of the light field. In addition, we examine the effect of the damping of the motion of the mirror on the field states inside the cavity and compare this with the effect of cavity field damping.},

As already shown experimentally A. A. Abdumalikov, Jr. et al., Phys. Rev. B 78, 180502R 2008, the strong coupling regime of cavity QED can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage of the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity QED where the rotating-wave approximation breaks down. This should allow an on-chip implementation of the E â¤ Jahn-Teller model.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors consider a system comprised of a collection of identical two-level atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field in the dipole approximation and with an externallly applied steady-state coherent driving field. The atoms are considered to interact with each other only via the electromagnetic field and are assumed to be constained within a volume much smaller than a resonance wavelength. The system is treated as a quantum-statistical ensemble in the rotating frame, rotating at the carrier frequency of the externally applied coherent field. The Hamiltonian in this frame is explicitly time independent and the exact analog of a spin temperature is defiend. The thermodynamic-Green's-function method is used to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of the system in the rotating frame. this results in a nonlinear relation between the applied field and the field in the volume containing the atoms. The expression is a nonlinear functions of the effective or spin temperature as well, and has the form of a first-order phase transition with the macroscopic atomic polarization as order parameter. In the low-spin-temperature limit, and for perfect tuning, the expression reduces to the exact form of the nonlinear relation for optical bistability derived by Bonifacio and Lugiato and relating the incident and transmitted fields for atoms in a ring cavity in the mean-field approximation. The results contain absorptive as well as dispersive contributions. These results predict essentially different behavior as a function of off tuning conpared with behavior predicted by others using statistical steady-state models far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In the limit of zero value for the applied field amplitude, the results reduce to the condition for the well-known second-order superradiant phase transition. The condition for the existence of the second-order phase transistion is shown to depend on the cavity tuning and the photon escape rate. The authors also show why, in light of the experiments in optical bistability, this second-order phase is difficult to observe.},

The study yields a unified treatment of the attractive and repulsive harmonic oscillator, liner potential and free particle Hamiltonians in a time-dependent formalism. Use of representation theory for the symmetry group permits simple derivations of addition and expansion theorems relating various solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, many of which are new.},

This approach is shown to approximate the correct spectrum of the full model if the continued fraction is truncated at sufficiently high order. In the second case, one considers the limit of a sequence of models defined in finite-dimensional state spaces. In contrast to the first, the second approach is ambiguous and can be justified only through recourse to the analyticity argument from the first method.},

Rev. Lett. 87, 210403 2001. In contrast to stirring a vortex-free condensate, where topological constraints require that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate, we find that phase defects in the initial noncondensed cloud are trapped en masse in the emerging condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered vortex configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into a regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final gas at different temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied by lattice melting associated with diminishing long-range correlations between vortices across the system.},

Modulating every second period of the potential, the original Bloch band splits into two subbands. The dynamics of quantum particles shows a coherent superposition of Bloch oscillations and Zener tunnelling between the sub-bands, a BlochâZener oscillation. Such a system is modelled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian which is a system of two minibands with an easily controllable gap. The dynamics of the system is investigated by using an algebraic ansatz leading to a differential equation of WhittakerâHill type. It is shown that the parameters of the system can be tuned to generate a periodic reconstruction of the wave packet and thus of the occupation probability. As an application, the construction of a matter wave beam splitter and a MachâZehnder interferometer is briefly discussed.},

By using high-quality resonators, a strong coupling regime can be reached experimentally in which atoms coherently exchange a photon with a single light-field mode many times before dissipation sets in. This has led to fundamental studies with both microwave2,3 and optical resonators4. To meet the challenges posed by quantum state engineering5 and quantum information processing, recent experiments have focused on laser cooling and trapping of atoms inside an optical cavity6â8. However, the tremendous degree of control over atomic gases achieved with BoseâEinstein condensation9 has so far not been used for cavity QED. Here we achieve the strong coupling of a BoseâEinstein condensate to the quantized field of an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity and present a measurement of its eigenenergy spectrum. This is a conceptually new regime of cavity QED, in which all atoms occupy a single mode of a matter-wave field and couple identically to the light field, sharing a single excitation. This opens possibilities ranging from quantum communication10â12 to a wealth of new phenomena that can be expected in the many-body physics of quantum gases with cavity-mediated interactions13,14.},

On the other hand, intelligent states (which are squeezed states for a system of general symmetry) also form a subset of algebra eigenstates. We develop the general formalism and apply it to theSU(2) andSU(1,1) simple Lie groups. Complete solutions to the general eigenvalue problem are found in both cases by a method that employs analytic representations of the algebra eigenstates. This analytic method also enables us to obtain exact closed expressions for quantum statistical properties of an arbitrary algebra eigenstate. Important special cases such as standard coherent states and intelligent states are examined and relations between them are studied by using their analytic representations.},

Since then, non-local correlation measurements have become ubiquitous in many areas of physics and have also been applied, beyond photons, to electrons, matter waves and subatomic particles. An important assumption in HBT interferometry is that the particles do not interact on their way from the source to the detectors. However, this assumption is not always valid. Here, we study the effects of interactions on HBT interferometry by considering the propagation of light ﬁelds in a nonlinear medium that induces interactions between the photons. We show that interactions affect multipath interference, limiting the ability to extract information on the source. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that proper analysis of the intensity ﬂuctuations can recover the size of the source, even in the presence of interactions.},

In the case of small amplitude solutions that bifurcate from the band edges of the linear problem this condition becomes especially simple. We find that the small amplitude solutions corresponding to the band edges alternate stability, with the first band edge being modulationally unstable in the focusing case, the second band edge being modulationally unstable in the defocusing case, and so on. This small amplitude result has a nice physical interpretation in terms of the effective mass of a particle in the periodic potential. We also consider, in somewhat less detail, some sideband instabilities in the small amplitude limit. We find that, depending on the Krein signature of the collision, these instabilities can be of one of two types. Finally we illustrate these results in the case where the potential V (x) is an elliptic function, where many of the relevant calculations can be done explicitly.},

We present an intrinsically stable, deterministic implementation of discrete quantum walks with single photons in space. The number of optical elements required scales linearly with the number of steps. We measure walks with up to 6 steps and explore the quantum-to-classical transition by introducing tunable decoherence. Finally, we also investigate the effect of absorbing boundaries and show that decoherence significantly affects the probability of absorption.},

The dependence of the atomic current on the lattice tilt changes from ohmic conductance to negative differential conductance within an experimentally accessible parameter regime.

  Abstract                 = {A quantum-nondemolition method to measure the number of photons stored in a high-Q cavity, introduced by Brune et al is described in detail. It is based on the detection of the dispersive phase shift produced by the field on the wave function of nonresonant atoms crossing the cavity. This shift can be measired by atomic interferometry, using the Ramsey separated-oscillatory-field method. The information acquired by detecting a sequence of atoms modifies the field step by step, until it eventually collpses into a Fock state. At the same time, the field phase undergoes a diffusive process as a result of the back action of the measurement on the photon-number conjugate cariable. Once a Fock state has been generated, its evolution under weak perturbation can be continuously monitored, revealing quantum jumps between various photon numbers. When applied to an initial coherent field, the intermediate steps of the measuring sequence produce quantum superpositions of classical fields, known as Schr{\"o}dinger cat states. Ways to prepare and detect these states in a cavity subjected to a weak relaxation process are discussed. The effects analyzed in this article could realistically be observed by using circular Rydberg atoms and a very high-Q superconducting microwave cavities. The possibility of photon manipulation through nonresonant atom-field interactions opens a domain in cavity-QED studies.},

This interaction leads to extreme quantum entanglement of the atom and field. However, the model also predicts that, at precisely half of the revival time, the atom and field become asymptotically disentangled. This disentanglement becomes more exact as the coherent-state amplitude increases. In this paper we investigate the nature of the pure-field-state superposition generated at such times. We show that this superposition is of distinguishable states of the field with the same amplitude but opposite phase. Interference between these components leads to nonclassical oscillations in photon-number distributions and squeezing in quadratures of the field. The Schrodinger-cat states of the field are highly transient, and depend very sensitively on the interaction time, the initial intensity of the field, and the atom-field detuning.},

  Abstract                 = {In the context of ultracold atoms in multimode optical cavities, the appearance of a quantum-critical glass phase of atomic spins has been predicted recently. Due to the long-range nature of the cavity-mediated interactions, but also the presence of a driving laser and dissipative processes such as cavity photon loss, the quantum optical realization of glassy physics has no analog in condensed matter and could evolve into a “cavity glass microscope” for frustrated quantum systems out of equilibrium. Here we develop the nonequilibrium theory of the multimode Dicke model with quenched disorder and Markovian dissipation. Using a unified Keldysh path integral approach, we show that the defining features of a low-temperature glass, representing a critical phase of matter with algebraically decaying temporal correlation functions, are seen to be robust against the presence of dissipation due to cavity loss. The universality class, however, is modified due to theMarkovian bath. The presence of strong disorder leads to an enhanced equilibration of atomic and photonic degrees of freedom, including the emergence of a common low-frequency effective temperature. The imprint of the atomic spin-glass physics onto the photon subsystem realizes a “photon glass” state and makes it possible to detect the glass state by standard experimental techniques of quantum optics.We provide an unambiguous characterization of the superradiant and glassy phases in terms of fluorescence spectroscopy, homodyne detection, and the temporal photon correlation function g(2)(τ ).},

A strong suppression of the cross section is observed for electrons below 4 eV, but not for linearly polarized light at the same intensity. We show that if the electrons are emitted in single-step, nonresonant coherent processes, rather than stepwise excitation, the centrifugal potential barrier in the atomic Hamiltonian produces this suppression.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a simple approach for understanding some general aspects of the irreversible dynamics of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model. By working in the dressed-state representation, it is possible to split the dynamics of populations and coherences. Then it can be shown that the coherence dynamics may present localization and dispersivelike decay behavior, whereas the population dynamics are characterized in terms of a classical diffusive process. These phenomena are studied by developing a perturbation theory that provides simple analytical results that could be applicable to any general source of irreversibility in the Jaynes-Cummings model. As an application, we extend and analytically characterize our previous reported results on heating and decoherence in trapped ions},

The approach can describe both the low density limit, where the system can be described as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of exciton-polaritons, and the high density limit, where the system enters a photon-dominated regime. In contrast to the exciton BEC-BCS crossover where the system approaches an electron-hole plasma, the polariton high density limit has strongly correlated electron-hole pairs. At intermediate densities, there is a regime with BCS-like properties, with a peak at nonzero momentum of the singlet pair function.

The energy spectrum shows evidence of the structure of the avoided level crossings as a function of the onsite interparticle interaction strength. On the dynamical side, a phase diagram of the transfer efficiency across ground-state and inverse sweeps is presented. A totally different scenario with respect to the original single-particle Landau-Zener scheme is found for ground-state sweeps, in which a breakdown of the adiabatic region emerges as the sweep rate decreases. On the contrary, the transfer efficiency across inverse sweeps reveals consistent results with the single-particle Landau-Zener predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we find that there is a critical value of the onsite interaction for which the transfer of particles starts to vanish independently of the sweep rate.

This occurs provided the interparticle interaction is above a critical or threshold value. Next, we analyse the evolution in time of the same observables in a set of coherent states to show that the N-particle Bose fluid reaches stationary states, whose expectation values turn out to coincide with those in the eigenestates. This stationary or collapsed state alternates with recurrent revivals. Here we show that the time spent in the stationary state increases with the number of particles, relatively to the time during the revivals.

  Abstract                 = {A promising technique has been proposed recently [Opt. Commun. 284, 1331 (2011), Opt. Commun. 284, 4107 (2011)] for breaking the diffraction limit of light. This technique consists of transforming a symmetrical Laguerreâ Gaussian LG0 p beam into a near-Gaussian beam at the focal plane of a thin converging lens thanks to a binary diffractive optical element (DOE) having a transmittance alternatively equal to -1 or Ã¾1, transversely. The effect of the DOE is to convert the alternately out-of-phase rings of the LG0 p beam into a unified phase front. The benefits of the rectified beam at the lens focal plane are a short Rayleigh range, which is very useful for many laser applications, and a focal volume much smaller than that obtained with a Gaussian beam. In this paper, we demonstrate numerically that the central lobeâs radius of the rectified beam at the lens focal plane depends exclusively on the dimensionless radial intensity vanishing factor of the incident beam. Consequently, this value can be easily predicted.},

  Abstract                 = {Expressions are derived for the electromagnetic fields of guided waves which are analogous to the quantum-mechanical equations representing barrier tunneling. This analogy is achieved by comparing the propagation constant of the Schrödinger time-independent wave equation with that of the electromagnetic wave equation in waveguide and by comparing the de Broglie wavelength of a particle with the wavelength of the waves that propagate the energy. This results in an expression relating the form of an arbitrary one-dimensional energy barrier to the physical dimensions of a section of waveguide. The analogy is tested by the propagation of energy in the TE10 mode at both the 3- and 6-cm bands for the cases of rectangular and hyperbolic barriers. Although evanescent modes are present at the discontinuous regions, the analog for the rectangular barrier, which is considered to be the worse case, is verified when an effective barrier length leff of about 1.2l is used. This experimental verification demonstrates the possibility of waveguide simulation of quantum-mechanical energy barriers and the practicality of utilizing an electromagnetic analog for demonstrating the tunneling phenomenon and provides a method for measurement of the transmission coefficient through an arbitrarily shaped barrier.},

The latter displays an extremely rich phase diagram including solid, superfluid, and supersolid phases.

We find that, due to atom-molecule interactions, solid phases can be stabilized at both (much) lower strengths of dipolar interaction and higher temperatures, than when no atoms are present. As a byproduct, atoms also order in a solid phase with the same melting temperatures as for molecules. Finally, we find that for large enough interaction between atoms and molecules, a paired supersolid phase can be stabilized.},

We provide an evaluation of the nearest-neighbor level-spacing distribution for the Cassini oval billiard, taking into account relations with classical results. The statistical behavior of integrable and ergodic systems has been extensively conﬁrmed numerically, but that is not the case for the transition between these two extremes. Our system’s classical dynamics undergoes a transition from integrability to chaos by varying a shape parameter. This feature allows us to investigate the spectral ﬂuctuations, comparing numerical results with semiclassical predictions founded on Percival’s conjecture. We obtain good global agreement with those predictions, in clear contrast with similar comparisons for other systems found in the literature. The structure of some eigenfunctions, displayed in the quantum Poincare´ section, provides a clear explanation of the conjecture},

The relations among the operators and state vectors under consideration are clarified in the context of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. The familiar case of the azimuthal angle variable ϕ and its "conjugate" angular momentum Lz is discussed. Various pitfalls associated with the periodicity problem are avoided by employing periodic variables (sinϕ and cosϕ to describe the phase variable. Well-defined uncertainty relations are derived and discussed. A detailed analysis of the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator excited in coherent states is given. A detailed analysis of the simple harmonic oscillator is given. The usual assumption that a (Hermitian) phase operator φ (conjugate to the number operator N) exists is shown to be erroneous. However, cosine and sine operators C and S exist and are the apprópriate phase variables. A Poisson bracket argument using action-angle (rather J, cosφ, sinφ) variables is used to deduce C and S. The spectra and eigenfunctions of these operators are investigated, along with the important "phase-difference" periodic variables. The properties of the oscillator variables in the various types of states are analyzed with special attention to the uncertainty relations and the transition to the classical limit. The utility of coherent states as a basis for the description of the evolution of the density matrix is emphasized. In this basis it is easy to identify the classical Liouville equation in action-angle variables along with quantum-mechanical "corrections." Mention is made of possible physical applications to superfluid systems.},

In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.},

It determines and is largely determined by either the asymptotic phases or the continuous part of the weight (spectral) function. Indeed this is more than an analogy. By appropriate limiting procedures one can pass from a result about orthogonal polynomials to one in scattering theory. Conversely, scattering theory throws considerable light on theorems about orthogonal polynomials.}

The proposed nonparaxial theory overcomes such limitations by modeling (i) any planar source in terms of sets of point sources with tensor statistical behavior, and (ii) the transport of the wave field on scalar, deterministic, time-independent, and nonparaxial propagation modes, defined only by the geometry of the boundary conditions of the experimental setups. So the field emission by the source and the space structure due to the modes are independent from each other. The theory provides a unified framework for the power and the states of spatial coherence and polarization of the field, as well as for interference and diffraction, and describes the significant changes suffered by the wave fields in the microdiffraction domain.},

The movable mirror can deviate far from an equilibrium position, it is assumed to be thin so that it is modeled by a δ function, and we use the exact modes of the complete system. The transparency and the mirror-position-dependent cavity resonance frequencies are built into the modes and this allows us to deduce that the radiation pressure force comes from a periodic potential with period half the wavelength of the ﬁeld. The exact modes and the radiation pressure potential allow us to give intuitive physical interpretations of the dynamics of the system and to obtain approximate analytic solutions for the motion of the mirror. Three regimes are identiﬁed depending on the intensity of the ﬁeld and it is found that the dynamics can be qualitatively very different in each of them with some regimes being very sensitive to the values of the parameters. Moreover, we determine conditions when the Maxwell-Newton equations used to describe the system constitute accurate approximations of the exact equations governing the dynamics.},

When the interaction strength reaches its critical value, both the number of photons and atoms in excited states in the cavity, together with their fluctuations, exhibit a sudden increase from zero. By employing symmetry-adapted coherent states, it is shown that these properties scale with the number of atoms, their reported divergences at the critical point represent the limit when this number goes to infinity, and, in this limit, they remain divergent in the superradiant phase.

  Abstract                 = {The interferometers now being developed to detect gravitational waves work by measuring the relative positions of widely separated masses. Two fundamental sources of quantum-mechanical noise determine the sensitivity of such an interferometer: (i) fluctuations in number of output photons (photon-counting error) and (ii) fluctuations in radiation pressure on the masses (radiation-pressure error). Because of the low power of available continuous-wave lasers, the sensitivit of currently planned interferometers will be limited by photon-counting error. This paper presents an analysis of the two types of quantum-mechanical noise, and it proposes a new technique-- the squeezed-state technique -- that allows one to decrease the photon-counting error while increasing the radiation-pressure error, or vice versa. The key requirement of the squeezed-state technique is that the state of the light entering the interferometer's normally unused input port must be not the vacuum, as in a standard interferometer, but rather a squeezed state ---a state whose uncertainties in the two quadrature phases are unequal. Squeezed states can be generated by a variety of nonlinear optica processes, including degenerate parametric amplification},

The key property of a two-photon device is that it excites pairs of output modes independently. Thus our new formalism deals with two modes at a time; a continuum multimode description can be built by integrating over independently excited pairs of modes. For a pair of modes at frequencies Ω±ε, we define (i) quadrature-phase amplitudes, which are complex-amplitude operators for modulation at frequency ε of waves ‘‘cos[Ω(t-x/c)]’’ and ‘‘sin[Ω(t-x/c)]’’ and (ii) two-mode squeezed states, which are the output states of an ideal two-photon device. The quadrature-phase amplitudes and the two-mode squeezed states serve as the building blocks for our formalism; their properties and their physical interpretation are extensively investigated.},

When the model is defined on a finite-size ring, zero-temperature correlations are periodic in time. However, in the thermodynamic limit, the system relaxes algebraically towards a stationary state which is well described, at least for some simple correlation functions, by the generalized Gibbs ensemble recently introduced by Rigol et al. (cond-mat/0604476). The critical exponent that characterizes the decay of the one-particle correlation function is different from the known equilibrium exponents.

Rather than solving the relevant wave equation for the fields, the present formalism exploits the transformation formulas for plane waves in moving media, and as a starting point a spectral (plane-wave) representation is constructed. The procedure applies to arbitrary orders of p, but for simplicity only first-order velocity effects are considered in detail. Then, similarly to the velocityindependent problem, waves in uniformly moving media are represented in terms of complex integrals, special function series, inverse-distance differential-operator series, and surface integrals. Since familiar and functions are used, the present representations are extensions of the corresponding velocitymdependent expressions. The latter are available at any given stage by letting the velocity vanish or by replacing the moving medium by free space. Scattering by circular cylinders and spheres is considered, and results are specialized to the case of thin cylinders; the new velocity effects introduce additional multipole terms. The original wavefunctions are transformed into the frame of reference of the medium at rest. Scattering by arbitrary objects moving in free space follows as a special case.},

This conjecture attracted wide interest because the differences between photons and electronsÃin their interactions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detectionÃmay open a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study of the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction. To date, claims of threedimensional photon localization have been based on observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave4Â±8 as it propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under close scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to residual absorption9Â±11, and because absorption itself may suppress localization3. Here we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a different approachÃmeasurement of the relative size of Â¯uctuations of certain transmission quantities. The variance of relative Â¯uctuations accurately reÂ¯ects the extent of localization, even in the presence of absorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both weakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in periodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it out in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminium spheres.},

The order parameter can be homogenous or vortex valued. In the homogenous case a winding number can be defined whose nonvanishing value signals topological effects. A vortex leads to a static, isolated, zero-energy solution. Its mode function is real and has been called âMajorana.â Here we demonstrate that the reality/Majorana feature is not confined to the zero-energy mode but characterizes the full quantum field. In a four-component description a change in basis for the relevant matrices renders the Hamiltonian imaginary and the full, space-time-dependent field is real, as is the case for the relativistic Majorana equation in the Majorana matrix representation. More broadly, we show that the Majorana quantization procedure is generic to superconductors, with or without the Dirac structure, and follows from the constraints of fermionic statistics on the symmetries of Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonian can always be brought to an imaginary form, leading to equations of motion that are real with quantized real-field solutions. Also we examine the Fock space realization of the zero-mode algebra for the Dirac-type systems. We show that a two-dimensional representation is natural, in which fermion parity is preserved.},

The Raman spectra show a large increase in the peaks at 490 and 605 cm21, owing to 4- and 3-membered ring structures in the silica network, indicating that densification occurs after exposure to the femtosecond laser pulses. The results are consistent with the formation of a localized plasma by the laser pulse and a subsequent microexplosion inside the glass.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding strongly correlated quantum systems is a central problem in many areas of physics. The collective behaviour of interacting particles gives rise to diverse fundamental phenomena such as confinement in quantum chromodynamics, electron fractionalization in the quantum Hall regime and phase transitions in unconventional superconductors and quantum magnets. Such systems typically involve massive particles, but optical photons can also interact with one another in a nonlinear medium. In practice, however, such interactions are often very weak. Here we describe a technique that enables the creation of a strongly correlated quantum gas of photons using one-dimensional optical systems with tight field confinement and coherent photon trapping techniques. The confinement enables the generation of large, tunable optical nonlinearities via the interaction of photons with a nearby cold atomic gas. In its extreme, we show that a quantum light field can undergo fermionization in such one-dimensional media, which can be probed via standard photon correlation measurements.},

Such a system also has profound implications for quantum information processing, serving as a long-term memory that can store the full quantum information contained in an optical pulse. Here, we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical waveguide coupled to an optomechanical crystal array, where light in the waveguide can be dynamically and coherently transferred into long-lived mechanical vibrations of the array.

It is found that a triple coupling involving a photon, a phonon and an atom cannot be described only by the quasi-orbital angular momentum at frequency resonance, there also exists the phenomenon of parameter resonance, namely, when the system parameters are matched in some way, the evolution of the end mirror of the cavity is conditioned by the dressed states of the photonâatom subsystem. The quantum decoherence due to this conditional dynamics is studied in detail. In the quasi-classical limit of very large angular momentum, this system will behave like a standard cavity-QED system described by the JaynesâCummings (JâC) model when the angular momentum operators are transformed to bosonic operators of a single mode. We test this observation with an experimentally accessible parameter.},

Transferring quantum information with high fidelity is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic fragility of quantum states. We report on the implementation of the perfect state transfer protocol applied to a photonic qubit entangled with another qubit at a different location. On a single device we perform three routing procedures on entangled states with an average fidelity of 97.1%. Our protocol extends the regular perfect state transfer by maintaining quantum information encoded in the polarisation state of the photonic qubit. Our results demonstrate the key principle of perfect state transfer, opening a route toward data transfer for quantum computing systems.},

In an electro-optic crystal, an applied electric field changes the index of refraction. A voltage applied to a given electrode configuration generates the electric field. For various initial excitations of the three guides, the optical power in each waveguide is calculated as a function of the voltage applied to the electrodes. The amount of optical power coupled from one outside waveguide to the other is calculated as a function of the applied voltage. The calculation is done for both asymmetric and symmetric perturbations to the index of refraction. For an initial excitation of the center waveguide, the optical power coupled to the two outside waveguides is calculated as a function of the applied voltage. It is calculated for both asymmetric and symmetric perturbations of the index of refraction. It is shown that, in general, the applied voltage that is necessary to transfer optical power from one outside waveguide to the other is lower for an asymmetric perturbation of the index of refraction. However, for transfer of optical power from the center waveguide to the two outside waveguides, the necessary applied voltage is lower for a symmetric perturbation.},

We derive a polaron master equation with which we study the dynamics of both the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom beyond previously employed semiclassical (Marcus-Jortner) rate analyses. We show (i) that in the absence of explicit dissipation of the vibrational mode, the semiclassical approach is generally unable to capture the dynamics predicted by our master equation due to both its assumption of one-way (exponential) electron transfer from donor to acceptor and its neglect of the spectral details of the environment; (ii) that by additionally allowing strong dissipation to act on the odorant vibrational mode, we can recover exponential electron transfer, though typically at a rate that differs from that given by the Marcus-Jortner expression; (iii) that the ability of the molecular switch to discriminate between the presence and absence of the odorant, and its sensitivity to the odorant vibrational frequency, is enhanced significantly in this strong dissipation regime, when compared to the case without mode dissipation; and (iv) that details of the environment absent from previous Marcus-Jortner analyses can also dramatically alter the sensitivity of the molecular switch, in particular, allowing its frequency resolution to be improved. Our results thus demonstrate the constructive role dissipation can play in facilitating sensitive and selective operation in molecular switch devices, as well as the inadequacy of semiclassical rate equations in analysing such behaviour over a wide range of parameters.},

We present a full vector analysis of Gaussian beam propagation by using the well-known method of the angular spectrum of plane waves. A Gaussian beam is assumed to traverse a charge-free, homogeneous, isotropic, linear, and nonmagnetic dielectric medium. The angular spectrum representation, in its vector form, is applied to a problem with a Gaussian intensity boundary condition. After some mathematical manipulation, each nonzero propagating electric field component is expressed in terms of a power-series expansion. Previous analytical work derived a power series for the transverse field, where the first term (zero order) in the expansion corresponds to the usual scalar paraxial approximation. We confirm this result and derive a corresponding longitudinal power series. We show that the leading longitudinal term is comparable in magnitude with the first transverse term above the scalar paraxial term, thus indicating that a full vector theory is required when going beyond the scalar paraxial approximation. In spite of the advantages of a compact analytical formalism, enabling rapid and accurate modeling of Gaussian beam systems, this approach has a notable drawback. The higher-order terms diverge at locations that are sufficiently far from the initial boundary, yielding unphysical results. Hence any meaningful use of the expansion approach calls for a careful study of its range of applicability. By considering the transition of a Gaussian wave from the paraxial to the spherical regime, we are able to derive a simple expression for the range within which the series produce numerically satisfying answers.

Although recently the BCS-BEC crossover in three-dimensional (3D) spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases has been intensively studied, the corresponding twodimensional (2D) crossover physics has remained unexplored. In this paper, we investigate, both numerically and analytically, the BCS-BEC crossover physics in 2D degenerate Fermi gases in the presence of the Rashba type of spin-orbit coupling.We derive the mean-field gap and atom-number equations suitable for 2D spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases and solve them numerically and self-consistently, from which the dependence of the ground-state properties (chemical potential, superfluid pairing gap, ground-state energy per atom) on the system parameters (e.g., binding energy, spin-orbit-coupling strength) is obtained. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for these ground-state quantities, which agree well with our numerical results within a broad parameter region. Such analytical expressions also agree qualitatively with previous numerical results for 3D spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases, where analytical results are lacking. We show that, with increasing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength, the chemical potential is shifted by a constant determined by the SOC strength. The superfluid pairing gap is enhanced significantly in the BCS limit for strong SOC, but increases only slightly in the BEC limit.},

Finally, we predict a novel interaction-induced topological transition, which is an abrupt variation from $\pi$ to zero of the Berry phase.},

We have shown that an enhancement of the induced nonlinearity can be achieved by two orders of magnitude with negative interaction strength, which implies a large negative qubit-field detuning as well. Bright solitons are found to be supported under perturbations only in the upper (optical) branch of polaritons, for which the corresponding group velocity is controlled by tuning the interacting strength. With the help of perturbation theory for solitons, we also demonstrate that the group velocity of these polariton solitons is suppressed by the diffusion process.},

In the absence of an intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter-intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force that pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle, and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, an attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds âpullingâ as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.},

Here we shall at ﬁrst identify a class ofX states, whose quantum discord can be evaluated analytically without any minimization, for which their algorithm is valid, and also identify a family ofX states for which their algorithm fails. And then we demonstrate that this special family of X states provides furthermore an explicit example for the inequivalence between the minimization over positive operator-valued measures and that over von Neumann measurements.},

For the initial Bell state with anticorrelated spins, entanglement sudden death (ESD) is absent in the RWA but does appear in the present numerical calculation without the RWA. Aperiodic entanglement evolution in the strong-coupling regime is observed. The strong atom-cavity coupling facilitates the ESD. The sign of the detuning plays an essential role in the entanglement evolution for strong coupling, which is irrelevant in the RWA. Analytical results based on an unitary transformation are also given, which could not modify the RWA picture essentially.

In particular, phononlike polaritons can give rise to high-amplitude transmission resonances which are much narrower than the scale set by internal photon losses.

A numerical approach is required, in general, to solve such nonlinear coupled systems involving the coupling of three or more modes. We find, however, that for certain structural configurations, such as triple-core couplers with the cores arranged in the shape of an isosceles triangle, the nonlinear coupled-mode equations for multiple-core couplers can be solved analytically under a resonant condition. lhe analytical solution indicates that power swapping among, for example, the three cores placed in the shape of an isosceles triangle can be aperiodic at high power, although power may flow from core to core periodically at low power},

  Abstract                 = {The LandauâZener model of a quantum mechanical two-level system driven with a linearly time-dependent detuning has served over decades as a textbook model of quantum dynamics. In their seminal work, Landau and Zener derived a non-perturbative prediction for the transition probability between two states, which often serves as a reference point for the analysis of more complex systems. A particularly intriguing question is whether that framework can be extended to describe many-body quantum dynamics. Here we report an experimental and theoretical study of a system of ultracold atoms, offering a direct many-body generalization of the LandauâZener problem. In a system of pairwise tunnel-coupled one-dimensional (1D) Bose liquids we show how tuning the correlations of the 1D gases and the tunnel coupling between the tubes strongly modify the original LandauâZener picture. The results are explained using a mean-field description of the inter-tube condensate wavefunction, coupled to the low-energy phonons of the 1D Bose liquid.},

The system we suggested is a resonant cold atomic ensemble having N configuration, with a control field consisting of two pairs of laser beams with different cross angles, which produce an electromagnetically induced quasiperiodic waveguide (EIQPW) for the propagation of a signal field. By appropriately tuning the incommensurate rate or relative modulation strength between the two pairs of control-field components, the signal field can exhibit the delocalization-localization transition as it transports inside the atomic ensemble. The delocalization-localization transition point is determined and the propagation property of the signal field is studied in detail. Our work provides a way of realizing wave localization via atomic coherence, which is quite different from the conventional, off-resonant mechanism-based Aubry-Andre model, and the great controllability of the EIQPW also allows an easy manipulation of the delocalization-localization transition.},

With balanced arrangement of gain and loss on individual dimers, the system exhibits a PT-symmetric phase for finite gain/loss parameter up to a critical value. The beam evolution in this complex kagome waveguide array exhibits a novel oscillatory rotation of optical power along the propagation distance. Long-lived local chiral structures originating from the nearly flat bands of the kagome structure are observed when the lattice is subject to a narrow beam excitation.},

It is found that there is negative dispersion induced by the self-induced transparency, which is not predicted by the theory with the slowly-varying-envelope approximation. The amount of the induced dispersion is determined by the total dispersion of the system required to be compensated by the Kerr effect. Numerical examples of the self-induced transparency in an erbium-doped fiber are shown.

  Abstract                 = {The study of superfluid fermion pairs in a periodic potential has important ramifications for understanding superconductivity in crystalline materials. By using cold atomic gases, various models of condensed matter can be studied in a highly controllable environment. Weakly repulsive fermions in an optical lattice could undergo d-wave pairing1 at low temperatures, a possible mechanism for high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides2. The lattice potential could also strongly increase the critical temperature for s-wave superfluidity. Recent experimental advances in bulk atomic gases include the observation of fermion- pair condensates and high-temperature superfluidity3â8. Experiments with fermions9â11 and bosonic bound pairs12,13 in optical lattices have been reported but have not yet addressed superfluid behaviour. Here we report the observation of distinct interference peaks when a condensate of fermionic atom pairs is released from an optical lattice, implying long-range order (a property of a superfluid). Conceptually, this means that s-wave pairing and coherence of fermion pairs have now been established in a lattice potential, in which the transport of atoms occurs by quantum mechanical tunnelling and not by simple propagation. These observations were made for interactions on both sides of a Feshbach resonance. For larger lattice depths, the coherence was lost in a reversible manner, possibly as a result of a transition from superfluid to insulator. Such strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice can be used to study a new class of hamiltonians with interband and atomâmolecule couplings14.},

The computational complexity of the PGD scales linearly with the dimension of the space wherein the model is defined, which is in marked contrast with the exponential scaling of standard grid-based methods. First introduced in the context of computational rheology by Ammar et al. [3,4], the PGD has since been further developed and applied in a variety of applications ranging from the solution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation of quantum mechanics to the analysis of laminate composites. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PGD in four problem categories related to computational rheology: (i) the direct solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for complex fluids in configuration spaces of high dimension, (ii) the development of very efficient non-incremental algorithms for transient problems, (iii) the fully three-dimensional solution of problems defined in degenerate plate or shelllike domains often encountered in polymer processing or composites manufacturing, and finally (iv) the solution of multidimensional parametric models obtained by introducing various sources of problem variability as additional coordinates.},

Lett. 103, 010402 (2009)] investigated the quantum states of an electromagnetic field in time-dependent linear media using a Hermitian linear invariant. The wave function obtained by them is represented in terms of an arbitrary weight function g(λl). Since the type of wave function varies depending on the choice of g(λl) in their problem, it may be a difficult task to construct a coherent state that resembles the classical state from their theory. We suggest, on the basis of a non-Hermitian linear invariant, another quantum state that is a kind of coherent state. The expectation value of canonical variables in this alternate state follows an exact classical trajectory. For a simple case in which the time dependence of the parameters (t), µ(t), and σ(t) disappears, we showed that the quantum energy expectation value in the alternate quantum state recovers exactly to the classical energy in the limit. This alternate state leads to the correspondence between the quantum and the classical behaviors of physical observables in a high-energy limit.},

For example, a quantum network can serve as a 'web' for connecting quantum processors for computation2,3 and communication4, or as a 'simulator' allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels5,6. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems7-12, entangled states have not been achieved for interconnects capable of 'mapping' multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here we demonstrate measurementinduced entanglement stored in four atomic memories; usercontrolled, coherent transfer of the atomic entanglement to four photonic channels; and characterization of the full quadripartite entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations13-16. Our work therefore constitutes an advance in the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks. We also show that our entanglement verification method is suitable for studying the entanglement order of condensed-matter systems in thermal equilibrium17,18.},

Despite intense research activity, such localized waves, referred to as light bullets, have remained elusive. In nonlinear propagation, three-dimensional light bullets tend to disintegrate as a result of inherent instabilities2,3. Threedimensional wave packets that propagate linearly have been reported4–9, but their utility is severely limited by the need to tailor the wave packet precisely to material properties. To overcome these limitations, we explore a new approach based on the one-dimensional Airy wave packet10. Here, we report the first observation of a class of versatile three-dimensional linear light bullets, which combine Bessel beams in the transverse plane with temporal Airy pulses. Their evolution does not depend critically on the material in which they propagate, and the consequent versatility will facilitate their study and applications ranging from bioimaging11 to plasma physics12.},

The concept expands on our previous proposal of paraxial accelerating Bessel-like beams to include beams with subwavelength lobes and/or large trajectory angles. Such waves are produced when the phase at the input plane is engineered so that the interfering ray cones are made to focus along the prespecified path. When the angle of these cones is fixed, the beams possess a diffraction-free Bessel profile on planes that stay normal to their trajectory, which can be considered as a generalized definition of diffractionless propagation in the nonparaxial regime. The analytical procedure leading to these results is based on a ray-optics interpretation of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction and is presented in detail. The evolution of the proposed waves is demonstrated through a series of numerical examples and a variety of trajectories.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a theoretical framework to tackle quantum non-Markovian dynamics based on a microscopic collision model (CM), where the bath consists of a large collection of initially uncorrelated ancillas. Unlike standard memoryless CMs, we endow the bath with memory by introducing interancillary collisions between next system-ancilla interactions. Our model interpolates between a fully Markovian dynamics and the continuous interaction of the system with a single ancilla, i.e., a strongly non-Markovian process. We show that in the continuous limit one can derive a general master equation, which, while keeping such features, is guaranteed to describe an unconditionally completely positive and trace-preserving dynamics. We apply our theory to an atom in a dissipative cavity for a Lorentzian spectral density of bath modes, a dynamics which can be exactly solved. The predicted evolution shows a significant improvement in approaching the exact solution with respect to two well-known memory-kernel master equations.}

This regime of ultrastrong light-matter coupling is enhanced for long-wavelength transitions, because for a given doping density, effective mass and number of quantum wells, the ratio ΩR∕ω12 increases as the square root of the intersubband emission wavelength. We characterize the quantum properties of the ground state (a two-mode squeezed vacuum), which can be tuned in situ by changing the value of ΩR, e.g., through an electrostatic gate. We finally point out how the tunability of the polariton quantum vacuum can be exploited to generate correlated photon pairs out of the vacuum via quantum electrodynamics phenomena reminiscent of the dynamical Casimir effect.},

This allows for a fast and robust numerical determination of the spectral properties of these models, avoiding the singularities usually arising at the so-called singular points. We also provide different determinant expressions for the normalization of the Bethe ansatz states and form factors of local spin operators, opening up possibilities for the study of larger systems, both integrable and nonintegrable. These expressions can be written in terms of the new set of variables and generalize the results previously obtained for rational Richardson-Gaudin models [A. Faribault and D. Schuricht, J. Phys.

  Abstract                 = {Superconducting circuits are macroscopic in size but have generic quantum properties such as quantized energy levels, superposition of states, and entanglement, all of which are more commonly associated with atoms. Superconducting quantum bits (qubits) form the key component of these circuits. Their quantum state is manipulated by using electromagnetic pulses to control the magnetic flux, the electric charge or the phase difference across a Josephson junction (a device with nonlinear inductance and no energy dissipation). As such, superconducting qubits are not only of considerable fundamental interest but also might ultimately form the primitive building blocks of quantum computers. The theory of quantum mechanics was originally developed to account for the observed behaviour of electrons in atoms. More than 80 years later, it is being used to explain the behaviour of superconducting circuits that can be hundreds of nanometres wide and can contain trillions of electrons. The quantum nature of these circuits is observable because they can be engineered to be isolated from the electrical environment and are thus represented by a single degree of freedom. Significant coupling to other degrees of freedom causes rapid decoherence, destroying the quantum state of the circuit so that it behaves classically. Unlike atoms, these circuits can be designed and constructed to tailor their characteristic frequencies, as well as other parameters. These frequencies can be controlled by adjusting an external parameter, and the coupling energy between two quantum bits (qubits) can be turned on and off at will. Superconducting quantum circuits are the subject of intense research at present, in part because they have opened up a new area of fundamental science and in part because of their long-term potential for quantum computing. In this review, we begin with a brief discussion of superconductivity and two of the superconducting properties that underlie how qubits operate: flux quantization and Josephson tunnelling. The three fundamental types of superconducting qubit - flux, charge and phase - are then described. This is followed by a review of the real-time, quantum-coherent dynamics of qubits and the limitations imposed by relaxation and decoherence, as well as the mechanisms of decoherence. We then discuss schemes for controlling the coupling between two qubits, a feature that greatly simplifies the implementation of proposed quantum-computing architectures. And we finish by discussing quantum optics on a chip, a new research direction in which the electromagnetic fields associated with control and read-out signals are treated quantum mechanically.},

  Abstract                 = {In this age of alternative energy, solar power is one of the main contenders for providing us with clean energy. In photosynthesis, the energy of solar photons is transformed into chemical energy. In solar cells, they generate electrical energy. Solar energy can also be used directly to produce heat and drive a generator, such as in solar furnaces. The thus acquired energy can be used for a myriad of purposes, including refrigeration [1]. In this Letter, we propose a simple solid state device that uses photons to perform the task of refrigeration directly, bypassing the need to first generate another form of energy. The hope is that such a cooling mechanism will be more efficient, by avoiding some of the losses that always accompany the transformation between different forms of energy. The fact that solar radiation, which has a temperature of about 5800 K, can be directly used to refrigerate may at first be surprising. The phenomenon itself is not novel, the most notable example being probably evaporative cooling (including ''sweating''); see, also, the optomechanical device recently proposed in [2]. Our device however is of an entirely different nature. It has the advantage of being a nanosized solid state device, with no moving parts, and no net electric currents, even though the cooling is the result of replacing ''hot'' electrons by ''cold'' electrons. This feature suggests that the construction could also be used in nano low temperature physics, where a cold black body radiation (for example from liquid helium) could be used as photonic input to reach much lower temperatures in an electronic nanosetting. Before turning to a quantitative analysis of the refrigerator, we explain its mode of operation. The device, which is schematically represented in Fig. 1, consists of two leads (or electron reservoirs), separated by two adjoining quantum dots, each with a lower and upper energy level. The basic idea is that under influence of the high temperature photons, cold electrons are pumped from the left to the right lead transversing through the junction of the lower energy levels of the quantum dots, while an equal amount of hot electrons are pumped the other way at the junction of the higher energy levels. The result is a net replacement of hot electrons by cold electrons in the right lead, implying its refrigeration. A qualitative explanation goes as follows. Consider first the distributions of electrons in the lead.},

The diffraction dynamics, abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum, and exceptional points in the band structure are examined in detail. In addition, the nonlinear properties of wave propagation in Kerr nonlinearity media are studied. In particular, coherent structures such as lattice solitons are numerically identified by applying the spectral renormalization method. The spatial symmetries of such lattice solitons follow the shifted PT-symmetric relations. Furthermore, such lattice solitons have a power threshold and their linear and nonlinear stabilities are critically dependent on their spatial symmetry point.},

  Abstract                 = {A general input-output theory for quantum dissipative systems is developed in which it is possible to relate output to input via the internal dynamics of a system. This is applied to the problem of computing the squeezing produced by a degenerate parametric amplifier located inside a cavity. The results for the internal modes are identical with those of Milburn and Walls [Opt. Commun. 39, 401 (1981)]. The output field is also found to have only 50%%uo of maximal squeezing. However, by taking the output for a degenerate parametric amplifier inside a single-ended cavity and feeding this into an empty single-ended cavity, one can produce a maximally squeezed state inside this second cavity.},

  Abstract                 = {An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the rate of coherent atomâphoton coupling can be made larger than all decoherence rates of the system. For single atoms, this âstrong coupling regimeâ of cavity quantum electrodynamics1,2 has been the subject of many experimental advances. Efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping3,4 the atomand cooling5,6 it towards the motional ground state; the latter has been achieved in one dimension so far5. For systems of many atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved7 in atomic BoseâEinstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently8,9, coupling BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity10 with atom-chip technology11. This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode12. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing- wave cavity field; we demonstrate that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate.Westudy the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atomsâcavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavityâatom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will be suitable as a lightâmatter quantum interface for quantum information13.},

The Mott criterion, which is based on the disappearance of all exciton bound states because of screening, gives ¥{\"e}  1. Since excitons feel each other through both Coulomb interaction and Pauli exclusion between their electrons and holes, criteria based on the underlying fermionic character of the exciton should be even more relevant. Two significant quantities are the boson departure 1.[B,B ¢{\'O} ] and boson number B ¢{\'O} B, where B ¢{\'O} is the exciton creation operator. Their expectation values in the N-exciton state are close to their boson values for ¥{\"e} ¡­ 100 and ¥{\"e} ¡­ 50, respectively. By contrast, the expectation value of BN(B ¢{\'O} )N in the vacuum state is close to N! for 25N2a3 x/V  1 only. This surprising N2-dependence comes from the intrinsic N-body character of Pauli exclusion. Consequences of these new criteria on the Bose condensation of excitons are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past ten years, the ideas of supersymmetry have been profitably applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large N expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order p.},

In particular, the super-radiant phase transition is studied. We find that results based on the mean-field method compare favorably with exact results. We also find that the results are much improved if the constant of motion of the model is implemented exactly, with the help of appropriate projection techniques, instead of being implemented only in the average.

  Abstract                 = {The thermodynamics of the dissipative two-state system is calculated exactly for all temperatures and level asymmetries for the case of Ohmic dissipation. We exploit the equivalence of the two-state system to the anisotropic Kondo model and extract the thermodynamics of the former by solving the thermodynamic Betheansatz equations of the latter. The universal scaling functions for the specific heat C(T) and static dielectric susceptibilit X(T) are extracted for all dissipation strengths 0 <a<1. The logarithmic corrections to these quantities at high temperatures are found in the Kondo limit a ->1, whereas for a<1we find the expected power law temperature dependences with the powers being functions of the dissipative coupling a. The low-temperature behavior is always that of a Fermi liquid },

We consider an effective Hamiltonian for the system and cavity losses, in the dressed atom picture, using the generalized master equation. We found a case where the quantum discord and the classical correlation are almost constant, and we also found multipartite entanglement, starting with only one excitation per chain. Finally, we propose a way to select the initial condition so that we can optimize the results for different purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {During the Spring of 1966, Ed Jaynes presented a seminar course on quantum electronics that included the now famous “Jaynes-Cummings Model” and his Neoclassical Theory (NCT). As part of this seminar series, the NCT description of a two-level atom in an applied field was formulated as a formidable set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. Undaunted, Ed posted the equations on the Washington University Physics Department bulletin board and offered a prize of “a steak dinner for two” at a restaurant of the choice of the person who solves the equations. Within days, Bill Mitchell was able to present an elegant solution at one of the quantum electronics seminars. This early success of a new approach to doing theoretical physics encouraged Ed to challenge the knowledge hungry Physics Department with Steak Dinner Problem II. This problem was a specific mathematical formulation of the exact (i.e. without the Rotating Wave Approximation) description of the interaction of a two-level atom with a single quantized electromagnetic field mode. Jaynes' formulation of the problem appears to have anticipated the use of Bargmann Hilbert space in QED. This problem has remained unsolved for 26 years in spite of the efforts of numerous researchers, most of whom were probably unaware of Jaynes' offered prize. Recent efforts to solve this problem will be described.}

  Abstract                 = {Fock states and coherent states have been widely applied in analyses of quantum-optics experiments. In this paper, the application of a set of basis functions that consist of a product of displaced harmonicoscillator states for the electromagnetic field and atomic states that are eigenfunctions of the momentum operator will be explored. For the case of a single mode, these states are the exact eigenfunctions in the limiting case where the electromagnetic-field mode frequency is much larger than the atomic transition frequency. This choice of basis functions will be used to analyze the interaction of a nonrelativistic, "two-level" atom with a single-frequency, quantized electromagnetic-field mode. Since in this basis the sign of the displacement of the electromagnetic-field state depends on the state of the atom, these new basis wave functions exhibit explicitly some aspects of atom-field correlations that are intrinsically quantum mechanical in nature. The analysis will be performed in the electric-dipole approximation for an atomic system that obeys the 6m=0 selection rule. The rotating-wave-approximation (RWA) terms cannot be made negligible through judicious choice of the field polarization for this system. The diamagnetic term, e A /2mc, which is of the same order of magnitude as the RWA terms, is taken into account exactly by slightly modifying the traditional approach to quantizing the electromagnetic field. In this way the physical effects of the diamagnetic term are absorbed into a new electromagnetic cavity mode frequency. An approximate expression for the combined system's energy eigenvalues is found up to third order in the ratio of one-half the atomic transition frequency to the mode frequency. This expression indicates that inclusion of the RWA terms adds a small "ripple" on top of the smoothly varying energy eigenvalues when they are plotted as a function of the atom-field coupling constant. The ripple is interpreted as "interference" between two displaced oscillator-field states that represents the unperturbed state. When the Fock states are used as the basis for expanding the wave function of this system, a formidable five-term recurrence relation results. However, expanding the wave function in terms of the displaced harmonic-oscillator basis results in a less formidable three-term recurrence relation for the quantum coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction of a nonrelativistic, "two-level" atom with a single-frequency, quantized electromagnetic field is usually analyzed in the dipole approximation by applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) to obtain the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In this paper, it is shown that for a spin- —particle, at rest in a constant magnetic field and for a system that obeys the electric dipole b I =+1 selection rules, a choice of a perturbing field that consists of circularly polarized photons can make the RWA unnecessary for the solution of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED) problem. For these cases, the only approximation necessary to obtain an exact solution of the @EDproblem is to neglect the spontaneous emission of photons with a sense of polarization opposite that of the perturbing field. The matrix elements corresponding to these "virtual" processes are independent of the number of photons n in the applied field and become relatively small, cornpared with those that correspond to energy-conserving processes, as n becomes large. However, a two-level system that obeys the Am =0 selection rule will require the RWA in order to reduce it to the JCM, regardless of the choice of polarization of the perturbing field. For this case, the emission of the photons that do not conserve energy is an induced process that corresponds to matrix elements that increase as &n + 1. It is thus concluded that, provided the right choice of selection rules and polarization of the applied field is made, the JCM provides a more accurate description of some systems than the accuracy of the RWA. Furthermore, it is concluded that an experimental test of the validity of the RWA can be made by performing the same experiments on an electric dipole Am =+1 transition, first with circularly polarized light and then with linearly polarized light of the same intensity. Any difference in response of the atomic system for these two experiments can be identified with terms that are neglected in the RWA. This experimental technique may prove useful for observing the optical Bloch-Siegert shift and for investigating the failure of the RWA and the chaotic quantum behavior predicted by Milonni, Ackerhalt, and Galbraith [Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 966 (1983)j.},

  Abstract                 = {Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication LOCC with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.},

We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of nonzero quantum discord for any dimensional bipartite states. This condition is easily experimentally implementable. Based on this, we propose a geometrical way of quantifying quantum discord. For two qubits this results in a closed form of expression for discord. We apply our results to the model of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit, showing that quantum discord is unlikely to be the reason behind its speedup.},

We present analytical and numerical results, with special emphasis on photon-added coherent and squeezed vacuum states. In particular, we show that adding photons to a squeezed vacuum yields Schrödinger-cat-like states in terms of superpositions of non-Gaussian squeezed coherent states.

The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach. },

  Abstract                 = {Canonical quantization of the electromagnetic (EM) field is carried out for the situation where the total charge and current densities are the sum of contributions from neutral dielectric atoms whose effect is to be described purely classically in terms of spatially dependent electric permittivity and magnetic permeability functions, and neutral, stationary radiative atoms whose interaction with the EM field is to be treated quantum mechanically. The coefficients for the expansion of the vector potential in terms of mode functions determined from a generalized Helmholtz equation are chosen as independent generalized coordinates for the EM field. The spatially dependent electric permittivity and magnetic permeability appear in a generalized Helmholtz’s equation and the former also occurs in the mode function orthogonality and normalization conditions. The quantum Hamiltonian is derived in a generalized multipolar form rather than the minimal coupling form obtained in other work. The radiative energy is the sum of quantum harmonic oscillator terms, one for each mode. The modes are independent in the present case of exact mode functions associated with the spatially dependent electric permittivity and magnetic permeability, there being no direct mode-mode coupling terms. In the electric dipole approximation the electric interaction energy contribution for each mode and radiative atom is proportional to the scalar product of the dipole operator with the mode function evaluated at the atom, times the annihilation operator, plus the Hermitian adjoint. This form has been widely used in studies of radiative processes for atomic systems in dielectric media, and it is justified here via the canonical quantization procedure. The results apply to the theoretical treatment of numerous quantum optical experiments involving such interactions in the presence of passive, lossless, dispersionless, linear classical optics devices such as resonator cavities, lenses, beam splitters, and so on. An illustrative application of the theory for atomic decay in a one-dimensional Fabry-Perot cavity is given.},

In this paper we describe a case with reduced frictional force, as the low-index particle is pinned to the wall of the sample cell. This results in a more efficient transfer of OAM, which sets a hollow microbead into orbital motion around the optical vortex. We show that the localized OAM carried by each vortex in the array can be independently transferred to one microbead trapped per vortex. Finally, we present novel demonstrations showing simultaneous transfer of both orbital angular and linear momentum to multiple microbeads.},

The formation of several defects, including Si E0 or Ge E0 centers, nonbridging oxygen hole centers, and peroxy radicals, was also detected.

The qubit-resonator interactions are described by the Jaynes-Cummings model.We argue that the presence of pure dephasing noise in such a qubit-resonator system will also induce an energy relaxation mechanism via a fluctuating dipole-coupling term. This random modulation of the coupling is seen to lead to rich physical behavior. For non-Markovian noise, the coupling can either worsen or alleviate decoherence, depending on the initial conditions. The magnetization noise leads to behavior resembling the collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations if the photons are in a coherent state. For a broad distribution of noise couplings, the frequency of these oscillations depends on the mean noise strength. We describe this behavior semianalytically and find it to be independent of the number of fluctuators. This phenomenon could be used as an in situ probe of the noise characteristics.},

The considerations provide us with a qualitative difference between the W state and GHZ state in the situation when they are separately sent via depolarizing channels. For sufficiently high amount of noise in the depolarizing channel, the GHZ states cannot produce a distillable state between two qubits, whereas the W states can still produce a distillable state in a similar situation.},

These beams, whose spectra (restricted to a circle) are doubly periodic Mathieu functions in azimuth, depend on a field strength parameter. When the parameter is zero, pendulum beams are Bessel beams, and as the parameter approaches infinity, they resemble transversely propagating one-dimensional Gaussian wave packets (Gaussian beam-beams). Pendulum beams are the eigenfunctions of an operator that interpolates between the squared angular momentum operator and the linear momentum operator. The analysis reveals connections with Mathieu beams, and insight into the paraxial approximation.},

Every proper real rational function is proved to be the m-function of a unique finite generalized Jacobi matrix. Moreover, every generalized Nevanlinna function m($\cdot$) which is a solution of a determinate indefinite moment problem turns out to be the m-function of a unique infinite generalized Jacobi matrix. The method we use is based on the step-by-step Schur process of solving the indefinite moment problem. The convergence of the sequence of subdiagonal Pade approximants for the corresponding Hamburger series is investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: âevery finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite meansâ. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the âuniversal quantum computerâ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include âquantum parallelismâ, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everettâs. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the âcomplexityâ or âknowledgeâ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Electromagnetic and scalar fields are quantized in the region near an arbitrary smooth boundary, and the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is calculated. The energy density is found to diverge as the boundary is approached. For nonconformally invariant fields it varies, to leading order, as the inverse fourth power of the distance from the boundary. For conformally invariant fields the coefficient of this leading term is zero, and the energy density varies as the inverse cube of the distance. An asymptotic series for the renormalized stress-energy tensor is developed as far as the inverse-square term in powers of the distance. Some criticisms are made of the usual approach to this problem, which is via the "renormalized mode sum energy, " a quantity which is generically infinite. Green's-function methods are used in explicit calculations, and an iterative scheme is set up to generate asymptotic series for Green's functions near a smooth boundary. Contact is made with the theory of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator. The method is extended to nonflat space-times and to an example with a nonsmooth boundary.},

This offers routes for colloidal self-assembly, crystallization, and organization of templates for biological and colloidal sciences. In this Colloquium, this emergent area is reviewed looking at the pioneering experiments in the field and the various theoretical approaches that aim to describe this behavior. The latest experimental studies in the field are reviewed and theoretical approaches are now beginning to converge to describe the binding behavior seen.

A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simultaneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout. Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance3, 4, 5, cold ion trap6, 7 and optical8 systems, but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and Deutsch–Jozsa quantum algorithms1, 2. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales, which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture9, 10. This interaction allows the generation of highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent. Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology.},

  Abstract                 = {The wave equation proposed in an earlier paper is examined from the point of view of the Heisenberg picture, for the purpose of getting a physical model. It is found that the position of the particle can roam about over a spherical shell under the influence of a kind of gauge transformation. With the passage of time the shell pulsates. The coordinates of the centre of the shell do not commute. These coordinates provide a reference point for defining orbital angular momentum which leads to zero spin for all momentum values.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to achieve multi-gigabit transmission (projected for 2020) for the use in interplanetary communications, the usage of large number of time slots in pulse-position modulation (PPM), typically used in deep-space applications, is needed, which imposes stringent requirements on system design and implementation. As an alternative satisfying highbandwidth demands of future interplanetary communications, while keeping the system cost and power consumption reasonably low, in this paper, we describe the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) as an additional degree of freedom. The OAM is associated with azimuthal phase of the complex electric field. Because OAM eigenstates are orthogonal the can be used as basis functions for N-dimensional signaling. The OAM modulation and multiplexing can, therefore, be used, in combination with other degrees of freedom, to solve the high-bandwidth requirements of future deep-space and near-Earth optical communications. The main challenge for OAM deepspace communication represents the link between a spacecraft probe and the Earth station because in the presence of atmospheric turbulence the orthogonality between OAM states is no longer preserved. We will show that in combination with LDPC codes, the OAM-based modulation schemes can operate even under strong atmospheric turbulence regime. In addition, the spectral efficiency of proposed scheme is N2/log2N times better than that of PPM.},

We find the conditions under which the usual unitary quantization schemes in time-dependent media with real dielectric permeability can be applied to the problem concerned with relatively small (a few per cent) error. We show that, by using a slab with thickness of the order of 1 mm, it is possible to generate a large number of microwave (GHz) photons (up to 108 or more) after several thousand picosecond pulses with repetition frequency of the order of 1 GHz, provided that semiconductor materials with high mobility of carriers, high photoabsorption efficiency and small recombination time (less than 1 ns) can be found.

Fast changes of conductivity from practically a zero value to a high one and then again to zero simulate periodical displacements of the cavity wall. This scheme has been chosen to model the non-stationary Casimir effect in the experiment which is under preparation at Padua University. We provide analytical and numerical evaluations for the number of photons which could be created under realistic experimental conditions. We show the importance of taking into account intrinsic losses in the semiconductor slab caused by the finite conductivity during the intermediate part of the excitation–recombination cycle. We analyse the influence of different parameters, such as the diffusion and mobility coefficients of carriers, surface recombination velocity, absorption coefficient of laser radiation, thickness of the slab and geometry of the cavity. We conclude that a significant amount (>103) of ‘Casimir photons’ with a frequency of 2.5 GHz can be produced from vacuum in a cavity with dimensions of the order of 10 cm, if one can arrange several thousand strongly periodical laser pulses with a duration of the order of 1 ps, periodicity close to 200 ps and energy 10−3 J, illuminating the semiconductor slab of thickness 1 mm and the mobility 1 m2 V−1 s−1, provided the recombination time can be reduced below the critical value 30 ps.}

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to contribute to the clarification of concepts usually found in books on quantum mechanics, aided by knowledge from the field of the theory of operators in Hilbert space. Frequently the basic distinction between bounded and unbounded operators is not established in books on quantum mechanics. It is repeatedly overlooked that the condition for an unbounded operator to be symmetric (Hermitian) is not sufficient to make it self-adjoint. To make things worse, nearly all operators in quantum mechanics are unbounded. Often one finds statements such as: For any linear operator A we can write a Hermitian operator H A = (A + A t)/2, where Hermitian is thought to mean selfadjoint. Along these lines, self-adjointness of the momentum operator in generalized coordinates, taken from that expression, is questioned. In particular, the redescription in terms of spherical polar coordinates and its implications for the eventual loss of self-adjointness of the momenta conjugate to them are studied.},

Kinetic energy is extracted from the atoms by superradiant light scattering to reach a final kinetic energy related to the cavity linewidth. The self-organization starts only above a threshold of the pump strength and atom number. We find a quadratic dependence of the cavity mode intensity on the atom number, which demonstrates the cooperative effect.},

In the first case, two modes take part in the power transfer, and unless the guides are very tightly coupled, periodic beats with high power transfer are obtained at multiples of the coupling length as in a two-guide coupler. In the second case, three modes take part in the power transfer, and periodic beats and high power-transfer efficiency can only be obtained if the propagation velocities of the three modes are related to each other in a simple way. This condition will occur only if the guides of a three-guide coupler made up of identical guides are much more loosely coupled than guides generally used in a two-guide coupler.},

This corresponds to a small signal optical bandwidth of = 3.0 GHz when the interferometer is biased in a linear portion of the optical output versus voltage characteristics. Reduction of parasitics should result in a substantial increase in the bandwidth of these devices.},

  Abstract                 = {To obtain maximum power transfer efficiency from one outside guide to another in a three-guide coupler, the differences among the propagation constants of the three propagating modes must be equal, i.e., PA - PC must equal PC - pB. This is not the case when all three guides are identical. By increasing either the width or index of the center guide relative to the outside guides, the differences between the propagation constants can be made equal. This can result in a significant increase in power transfer from one outside guide to the other. With equal spacing between the propagation constants of the modes, overall power transfer efficiency is limited only by radiation losses at the input and output of the three-guide coupler, due to the imperfect match between the mode shape of the input and output guides and the shape of the linear combination of the three modes of the coupler which best matches it. For couplers with reasonable guide spacing to guide width ratios S and reasonable confinement, this loss is usually small, and power transfer efficiencies for power transfer from one outside guide to another can approach 100 percent. For example, with correctly adjusted p’s, power transfer efficiency in a three-guide coupler with S = 1 can be as high as 99.8 percent. Even with S = 0.5, efficiencies can be as high as 97.8 percent.},

The performance of these couplers at 1.28 pm is in close agreement with that predicted using a modified effective-index method to obtain an approximate analytical solution for this type ofcoupler. The coupling length needed to symmetrically transfer power from the center guide to the twg,outside guides was 3.2 mm. At this length,less than 1 percent of the power remained in the center guide. The length needed to transfer power from one outside guide to the other outside guide was m6.4 mm, which is times that of a similar two-guide coupler and twice that required to couple power from the center guide to the two outside guides. The power transfer efficiency in this case is not as good as when power was inputted into the center guide. Three-guide couplers of this type should prove useful as power dividers and combiners, especially in cases where waveguide bend losses preclude the use of “Y”- junctions. They may also prove useful as replacements for two-guide couplers where either sharper transfer characteristics are desired or where losses due to waveguide bends are again unacceptable.},

The transmitted light shows a transition from a single-peaked spectrum to a double-peaked spectrum above the threshold of the lower branch. Fluctuations in the field are reduced on the upper branch and both photon bunching and photon antibunching are predicted, for different operating points. An exact solution obtained for the steady-state generalised P function shows decidedly non-equilibrium behaviour, e.g. the lack of a Maxwell construction.},

The article begins with a brief discussion of Richardson’s early work, which demonstrated the exact solvability of the pure pairing model, and then shows how that work has evolved recently into a much richer class of exactly solvable models. The Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between these quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This analogy is then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit of the pure pairing Hamiltonian. Several applications to problems of relevance to condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and the physics of confined systems are considered. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed in the context of these exactly solvable models include (i) the crossover from superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated regime in small metallic grains; (ii) the role of the nucleon Pauli principle in suppressing the effects of high-spin bosons in interacting boson models of nuclei, and (iii) the possibility of fragmentation in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided into the origin of the superconducting phase transition both in two-dimensional electronic systems and in atomic nuclei, based on the electrostatic image of the corresponding exactly solvable quantum pairing models.},

We propose a scheme to measure the state of an unknown field using an atomic probe driven by a reference field. This is a variation of the atomic homodyne detection method devised by Wilkens and Meystre [Phys. Rev. A 43, 3832 (1991)].We have shown in a previous article [Phys. Rev.

In this extension of that work, the atoms are weakly coupled to the driving field although they can couple much more strongly to the cavity field. We show that this enables us to neglect the e6'ects of quantum fluctuations in the driving field over the relevant time scales and allows us to measure more precisely the state of the unknown field by detecting the atoms that exit the cav- ity in the excited state.},

  Abstract                 = {We use Thomsonâs classical concept of mode of a leaky cavity to develop a quantum theory of cavity damping. This theory generalizes the conventional system-reservoir theory of high-Q cavity damping to arbitrary Q. The small system now consists of damped oscillators corresponding to the natural modes of the leaky cavity rather than undamped oscillators associated with the normal modes of a fictitious perfect cavity. The formalism unifies semiclassical Fox-Li modes and the normal modes traditionally used for quantization. It also lays the foundations for a full quantum description of excess noise. The connection with Siegmanâs semiclassical work is straightforward. In a wider context, this theory constitutes a radical departure from present models of dissipation in quantum mechanics: unlike conventional models, system and reservoir operators no longer commute with each other. This noncommutability is an unavoidable consequence of having to use natural cavity modes rather than normal modes of a fictitious perfect cavity.},

We show that these two systems are examples of nontrivial motion which is straightforward to treat using the unified scattering formalism of Tanguy and co-workers. This enables us to compare the diffractive and diffusve approximations with the exact solution of the effective master equation. Our analysis is fully quantum mechanical and in our numerical treatment of the effective master equation we are able to include spontaneous emission to all orders. We find that whereas the diffractive approximation correctly describes scattering from a traveling and a standing wave for short interaction times, the diffusive approximation cannot account for the persistence of diffractive structure for the case of the standing wave. To get good agreement we use an approximation which incorporates both diffractive and diffusive effects},

This paper deduces from the same theoretical model the statistical behavior to be expected for a finite stretch of observed eigenvalues chosen out of a much longer stretch of unobserved ones. In comparing the model with experimental data, we have always to deal with such a finite stretch of observed levels. Three "statistics" are investigated; these are quantities which can be computed directly from the observed data, and for which the expectation values and statistical variances can be calculated from the theory. One statistic gives only a precise way of measuring the average level spacing. One provides a test of the model by measuring the degree of long-range order in the level series. The third provides an independent test of the model by measuring the degree of short-range order. In Sec. V these methods are applied to a preliminary analysis of some experimental data on neutron capture levels in heavy nuclei. The results are inconclusive. Discrepancies between theory and observation are large, but the discrepancies might be produced either by incompleteness of the data or by incorrectness of the theoretical model.},

Solutions of simultaneous equations for T_c as obtained by formal application of the BCS theory, and for the Fermi energy at Tc, are also obtained in bulk material; but in is shown that at low carrier concentrations the temperature Tp at which pairing takes place is given by tp = 2Tc, while it is thought that superconductivity will not set in until a lower temperature, of the order of the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature of the pairs , is reached.

  Abstract                 = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by the wave function is not complete.},

In the forward propagation direction, an input TM polarized beam experiences a perfect state transfer between the input and output waveguide channels while surface Bloch oscillations block the backward transmission between the same ports. Our analysis indicates a large isolation ratio of 75 dB after a propagation distance of 8 mm inside seven coupled waveguides. Moreover, we demonstrate that, a judicious choice of the nonreciprocity in this same geometry can lead to perfect polarization splitting},

Starting from a Lagrangian formalism, we establish the connection between light dynamics in these configurations and the seemingly different physics of “supersymmetric” parametric oscillators. Using this powerful tool, we present analytical solutions for optical beam propagation in local PT -invariant coupled systems and we show that the intensity tunneling between the two channels critically depends on the initial conditions. For unbalanced inputs, symmetric as well as asymmetric power evolution can be observed depending on the excitation channel. On the other hand, under certain physical conditions, our analysis predicts that for a modal PT -symmetric input, a unidirectional fractional phase exchange can take place. Few cases where analytical solutions cease to exist are also investigated numerically. Finally, by exploiting the supersymmetric nature of the oscillator equations, we show that under certain initial conditions, one can obtain the propagation dynamics of field amplitudes that “resides” on the supersymmetric eigenfunctions of the system-a phenomenon we call resonant propagation.},

These waveguides are placed close enough to allow exchange of energy between them via evanescent waves. Each mode interacts with the atom in the same waveguide in the standard way as the JaynesâCummings model (JCM) and with the atom-mode system in the second waveguide via the evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for this system and deduce its wavefunction. We investigate the atomic inversions and the second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional coupler the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects. The atomic inversions can exhibit a long revivalâcollapse phenomenon as well as subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in the system. Finally, under certain conditions the system can yield the results of the two-mode JCM.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the quantum-chaotic properties of the Dicke Hamiltonian; a quantum-optical model that describes a single-mode bosonic field interacting with an ensemble of N two-level atoms. This model exhibits a zero-temperature quantum phase transition in the N⃗∞ limit, which we describe exactly in an effective Hamiltonian approach. We then numerically investigate the system at finite N, and by analyzing the level statistics, we demonstrate that the system undergoes a transition from quasi-integrability to quantum chaotic, and that this transition is caused by the precursors of the quantum phase transition. Our considerations of the wave function indicate that this is connected with a delocalization of the system and the emergence of macroscopic coherence. We also derive a semiclassical Dicke model that exhibits analogues of all the important features of the quantum model, such as the phase transition and the concurrent onset of chaos.},

Most of the attempts have been performed either with spin angular momentum using light's polarization or using orbital angular momentum with twisted beams. We experimentally demonstrate here the exchange of angular momentum from a linearly polarized plane wave to a two dimensional asymmetric object. More precisely, we show that the diffracted light from a snail-shaped mask carries local orbital angular momentum whose topological charge depends on the symmetry of the object. This opens the way to a means to produce micrometer-sized twisted beams from a high power laser or even pulsed beams.},

Finally, the effects of strongly driving the transverse breathing mode with large amplitude are investigated. In this case, impact-oscillator behavior and intriguing nonlinear dynamics, including the gradual emergence of multiple longitudinal modes, are observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems offer a robust and scalable platform for quantum optics experiments and the development of quantum information processing devices. In particular, systems based on photonic crystal nanocavities and semiconductor quantum dots have seen rapid progress. Recent experiments have allowed the observation of weak1 and strong coupling2, 3 regimes of interaction between the photonic crystal cavity and a single quantum dot in photoluminescence. In the weak coupling regime1, the quantum dot radiative lifetime is modified; in the strong coupling regime3, the coupled quantum dot also modifies the cavity spectrum. Several proposals for scalable quantum information networks and quantum computation rely on direct probing of the cavity–quantum dot coupling, by means of resonant light scattering from strongly or weakly coupled quantum dots4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Such experiments have recently been performed in atomic systems10, 11, 12 and superconducting circuit QED systems13, but not in solid-state quantum dot–cavity QED systems. Here we present experimental evidence that this interaction can be probed in solid-state systems, and show that, as expected from theory, the quantum dot strongly modifies the cavity transmission and reflection spectra. We show that when the quantum dot is coupled to the cavity, photons that are resonant with its transition are prohibited from entering the cavity. We observe this effect as the quantum dot is tuned through the cavity and the coupling strength between them changes. At high intensity of the probe beam, we observe rapid saturation of the transmission dip. These measurements provide both a method for probing the cavity–quantum dot system and a step towards the realization of quantum devices based on coherent light scattering and large optical nonlinearities from quantum dots in photonic crystal cavities.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing optimal control methods of open quantum systems rely on extensive numerical simulations of the dynamics in the presence of a bath, or alternatively ignore the exact bath dynamics. If the bath effects are to be treated properly on both Markovian and non-Markovian timescales using numerical simulations, the number of bath modes cannot be large. This may affect the ability to simulate realistic scenarios. Even if realistic, such simulations are hard to interpret physically. An alternative approach advocated here is to resort to a perturbative analysis provided the systemâbath coupling is weak. This analysis would allow for the effects of any given bath (finite or infinite, Markovian or non-Markovian) and any control at our disposal. This poses the challenge of constructing a method for the optimization of various operations requiring proper manipulation of the system, based on a general perturbative treatment to second order in the systemâbath coupling. This proposed treatment yields a universal tool for optimizing the fidelity of a given operation. It involves a fidelity-control matrix: a construct that allows us to prioritize the use of available control resources so as to maximize the operation fidelity in any given bath. As an analytically solvable example of this general method, we analyse quantum state-transfer optimization, from a ânoisyâ (write-in) qubit to its âquietâ counterpart (storage qubit). Intriguing interplay is revealed between our ability to avoid bath-induced errors that profoundly depend on the bath-memory time and the limitations imposed by leakage out of the operational subspace. Counterintuitively, under no circumstances is the fastest transfer optimal (for a given transfer energy).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the interaction between a Λ-type three-level atom and a two-mode cavity field is discussed. The detuning parameters and cross-Kerr nonlinearity are taken into account, and it is assumed that the atom–field coupling and Kerr medium are f -deformed. Even though the system seems complicated, the analytical form of the state vector of the entire system for the considered model is exactly obtained. The time evolution of nonclassical properties, such as quantum entanglement and position–momentum entropic uncertainty relation (entropy squeezing) of the field are investigated. In each case, the influences of the detuning parameters, generalized Kerr medium, and intensity-dependent coupling on the latter nonclassicality signs are analyzed in detail.},

We reveal rich phase diagrams, including a ﬁrst-order quantum phase transition from an electric superradiant phase to a magnetic superradiant phase. In particular, when the two collective atom-photon coupling strengths are equal, we ﬁnd a hidden continuous U(1) symmetry for the two-mode Dicke model. If these identical coupling strengths are sufﬁciently strong, a quantum phase called the electromagnetic superradiant phase is predicted. In such a phase, the predicted continuous U(1) symmetry breaks down and the gapless excitation spectrum (the Nambu-Goldstone mode), which could be measured experimentally by combining Bragg spectroscopy and cavity-enhanced Bragg scattering, is thus achieved.

This is done by employing a recent ''deformation'' method used to give a quantumlike phase-space description of charged-particle-beam transport in the semiclassical approximation. By taking into account the uncertainty relation diffraction limit that holds between the transverse-beam-spot size and the rms of the light-ray slopes, the classical phase-space equation for light rays is deformed into a von Neumann-like equation that governs the phase-space description of the beam transport in the semiclassical approximation. Here, and the time are replaced by the inverse of the wave number, ” , and the propagation coordinate, respectively. In this framework, the corresponding Wigner-like picture is given and the quantumlike corrections for an arbitrary refractive index are considered. In particular, it is shown that the paraxial-radiation-beam transport can also be described in terms of a fluid motion equation, where the pressure term is replaced by a quantumlike potential in the semiclassical approximation that accounts for the diffraction of the beam. Finally, a comparison of this fluid model with Madelung's fluid model is made, and the classical-like picture given by the tomographic approach to radiation beams is advanced as a future perspective.},

Here, we show the experimental realization of chip-scale unidirectional reflectionless optical metamaterials near the spontaneous parity-time symmetry phase transition point where reflection from one side is significantly suppressed. This is enabled by engineering the corresponding optical properties of the designed parity-time metamaterial in the complex dielectric permittivity plane. Numerical simulations and experimental verification consistently exhibit asymmetric reflection with high contrast ratios around a wavelength of of 1,550 nm. The demonstrated unidirectional phenomenon at the corresponding parity-time exceptional point on-a-chip confirms the feasibility of creating complicated on-chip parity-time metamaterials and optical devices based on their properties.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we extend the scalar wave propagation method (WPM) to vector fields. The WPM [Appl. Opt. 32, 4984 (1993)] was introduced in order to overcome the major limitations of the beam propagation method (BPM). With the WPM, the range of application can be extended from the simulation of waveguides to simulation of other optical elements like lenses, prisms and gratings. In that reference it was demonstrated that the wave propagation scheme provides valid results for propagation angles up to 85Â° and that it is not limited to small index variations in the axis of propagation. Here, we extend the WPM to three-dimensional vectorial fields (VWPMs) by considering the polarization dependent Fresnel coefficients for transmission in each propagation step. The continuity of the electric field is maintained in all three dimensions by an enhanced propagation vector and the transfer matrix. We verify the validity of the method by transmission through a prism and by comparison with the focal distribution from vectorial Debye theory. Furthermore, a two-dimensional grating is simulated and compared with the results from three-dimensional RCWA. Especially for 3D problems, the runtime of the VWPM exhibits special advantage over the RCWA.},

Then A, can be handled as though it were an ordinary numerical function of s. An increase in ease of manipulating some operator expressions results. Connection to the theory of functionals is discussed in an appendix. Illustrative applications to quantum mechanics are made. In quantum electrodynamics it permits a simple formal understanding of the interrelation of the various present day theoretical formulations. The operator expression of the Dirac equation is related to the author's previous description of positrons. An attempt is made to interpret the operator ordering parameter in this case as a fifth coordinate variable in an extended Dirac equation. Fock s parametrization, discussed in an appendix, seems to be easier to interpret.

  Abstract                 = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman’s space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the ease of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

We show that a transient entanglement can be created between the atoms only if the counter-rotating terms are taken into account in the interaction Hamiltonian. The source of the entanglement is identiﬁed, and the entanglement features are explained in terms of the properties of the reduced density operator of the atoms. In particular, we ﬁnd that the main source of the entanglement is in the two-photon coherence induced by the counter-rotating terms that cause two-photon transitions through virtual states.},

The polarization measurement of the first photon triggers a polarization-sensitive imaging of its partner photon, the vector photon, using a single-photon-sensitive camera. Thereby, the vector photon's complex polarization pattern is reconstructed tomographically dependent on the type of polarization measurement performed on its partner. To evaluate the quality of the observed patterns, we introduce a fidelity-like measure which compares the reconstructed polarization with the theoretically expected one at every transverse spatial position. We find that the measured polarization patterns and the theory overlap by more than 90%. Moreover, we visualize the varying strengths of polarization entanglement for different transverse regions and demonstrate an interesting phenomenon: Each vector photon can be both entangled and not entangled in polarization with its partner photon. We give an intuitive, information-theoretical explanation for our results. Our results pave the way to study quantum properties of the rich field of such complex light modes with the potential to improve various applications in quantum informational tasks.},

As long as spontaneous electronic transitions are negligible, analytical results are derived for describing the interaction of the trapped ion and the damped cavity field in the secular approximation. Under more general conditions, when the secular approximation breaks down and spontaneous emission effects become important, the dynamics of the system is studied by quantum-trajectory methods. As an example we demonstrate that, by exploiting the nonlinearities inherent in the dynamics of the system, one may prepare correlated vibronic states and vibrational Fock states. Moreover, we study the generation of an entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Taking into account the decoherence due to electronic and cavity losses, the best fidelity is obtained under conditions far from the Lamb-Dicke regime.},

Here, we demonstrate that this dark state can be excited using local phase control of individual qubit drives to change the symmetry of the excitation field. We observe that the dark state decay via spontaneous emission into the cavity is suppressed, a characteristic signature of subradiance. This local control technique could be used to prepare and study highly correlated quantum states of cavity-coupled qubits.},

In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode splitting is used to investigate the nature of matterâlight interaction at a quantummechanical level. However, this effect can, at least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of two coupled linear oscillators12. It has been suggested that an observation of the scaling of the resonant atomâphoton coupling strength in the JaynesâCummings energy ladder13 with the square root of photon number n is sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature14. Here we report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system, our measurements provide unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the quantum nature of the resonant atomâfield interaction in cavity QED. We explore atomâphoton superposition states involving up to two photons, using a spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in a circuit QED set-up15, in which very strong coupling is realized by the large dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit embedded in a high-quality on-chip microwave cavity.

Mixing of the input or output channels still allows strong photon antibunching of the output ﬁeld, but for optimal values of the system parameters that differ substantially from those that maximize antibunching of the intracavity ﬁeld. This result shows that the speciﬁc input-output geometry in a photonic system determines the optimal design in view of a single-photon device operation. We provide a compact analytical formula that allows ﬁnding the optimal parameters for each speciﬁc system geometry.},

In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.},

The latter is used to express the polarization-altering properties of Jones–Mueller matrices in a simple and elegant way. In particular, it is shown that the action of a diattenuator on a Stokes vector can be understood in terms of the addition law for velocities from SR. An important simplification in the resulting mathematical expressions further arises if the degree of polarization of a Stokes vector is represented by a hyperbolic polarization angle. This then allows us to demonstrate that the output hyperbolic polarization angle is related to a diattenuator hyperbolic polarization angle and the input hyperbolic polarization angle by the hyperbolic law of cosines holding in a hyperbolic triangle.},

The main aim of the paper is to show that, changing the quantization axis with respect to the common usage, it is possible to prove a general result either for N or the coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model. This completes the analysis, known in the current literature, with respect to the same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity, keeping the density constant. For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by the Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of quantization is defined by the interaction. The relevance of this result relies on the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using electromagnetic interaction and so, one can state that the thermodynamic limit is enough to grant the appearance of classical effects. Indeed, recent experimental results give first evidence that superposition states disappear interacting with an electromagnetic field having a large number of photons. {\'O} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A special model which considers the coupling to arise from a single mode of vibration is presented. Two limiting cases which can be treated approximately by perturbation theory are considered in detail.

In the first example we study Talbot imaging in different configurations comprising illumination with spherical beams or with Gaussian beams and propagation in homogeneous or inhomogeneous gradient-index media. In the second example we derive an exact analytical solution for the propagation of self-accelerating parabolic beams in parabolic gradient-index media.

  Abstract                 = {Controlling the way light interacts with material excitations is at the heart of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the strongcoupling regime, quantum emitters in a microresonator absorb and spontaneously re-emit a photon many times before dissipation becomes effective, giving rise to mixed lightâmatter eigenmodes1â12. Recent experiments13 in semiconductor microcavities reached a new limit of ultrastrong coupling14, where photon exchange occurs on timescales comparable to the oscillation period of light. In this limit, ultrafast modulation of the coupling strength has been suggested to lead to unconventional QED phenomena14,15. Although sophisticated lightâmatter coupling has been achieved in all three spatial dimensions, control in the fourth dimension, time, is little developed. Here we use a quantum-well waveguide structure to optically tune lightâmatter interaction from weak to ultrastrong and turn on maximum coupling within less than one cycle of light. In this regime, a class of extremely nonadiabatic phenomena becomes observable. In particular, we directly monitor how a coherent photon population converts to cavity polaritons during abrupt switching. This system forms a promising laboratory in which to study novel sub-cycle QED effects and represents an efficient room-temperature switching device operating at unprecedented speed.},

The phenomenon is known as blockade of excitation. Recently, extensive studies have been devoted to the so-called Rydberg blockade between neutral atoms, which appears when the atoms are in highly excited electronic states, owing to the interaction induced by the accompanying large dipole moments. Rydberg blockade has been proposed as a basic tool in quantum-information processing with neutral atoms1â5, and can be used to deterministically generate entanglement of several atoms. Here, we demonstrate Rydberg blockade between two atoms individually trapped in optical tweezers at a distance of 4 m. Moreover, we show experimentally that collective two-atom behaviour, associated with the excitation of an entangled state between the ground and Rydberg levels, enhances the allowed single-atom excitation. These observations should be a crucial step towards the deterministic manipulation of entanglement of two or more atoms, with possible implications for quantum-information science, as well as for quantum metrology, the study of strongly correlated systems in many-body physics, and fundamental studies in quantum physics.},

We discuss a number of results from calculations of attosecond pulse generation obtained by simultaneous solution of the time-dependent SchrÂ¨ dinger equation and the Maxwell wave equation.

  Abstract                 = {We obtain the eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and typical wave-packet dynamics of a "harmonic oscillator" defined on a lattice, when subjected to an added constant force field a. The eigenfunctions of this displaced harmonic oscillator are given in terms of Mathieu functions. In the momentum representation, the Mathieu eigenfunctions have period ~ (or 2m) when the bottom of the parabolic potential we11 corresponds to a lattice point (or is halfway between two lattice points). This occurs when a is an integer (or half-integer) in units of the force needed to stretch the oscillator by one lattice constant. For an incommensurate displacement of the well (i.e., for o; irrational in the above units) the eigenfunctions are not periodic. In real space, the eigenfunctions are displaced zero-field eigenfunctions centered on the new equilibrium position only for the cx integer. The eigenvalues are obtained as the sum of a periodic function of the force a, plus an overall quadratic shift in a. While this quadratic term is common to the continuum limit of the theory, the first periodic one is not. As n is turned on, the periodically varying relative position of the parabolic well with respect to the underlying lattice gives rise to the oscillating term for the energy eigenvalues. The time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is followed, and, in contrast with the continuum limit, its noncoherency is displayed. Damped oscillations of this wave packet occur between the spatial limits imposed by the parabolic well, or between those given by a Bloch oscillation. The "periods" for these two types of motion are quite different, and each depends on both the force a and on the spring constant of the oscillator. As time increases, Bloch osci11ations are eventually destroyed by the inhomogeneous restoring force of the harmonic oscillator, but not by the constant force field. Finally, we compare and contrast our results with the predictions of the semiclassical solid-state model, especially those involving effects due to Bloch oscillations.},

Although such recurrence relations are compact and straight-forward to evaluate, the function value and the derivative might overflow while the ratio may still be a reasonable machine number. We describe, in this paper, how to avoid overflow and derive a new recurrence relation which allows us to compute the ratio directly.},

New insights into the optical pulling force, which is usually represented by integrating the stress tensor at a black box enclosing the object, are interpreted by the optical singularity of the Poynting vector. The negative nonconservative pulling force originates from the transfer of the azimuthal Poynting vector to the longitudinal component partly owing to the presence of a scatterer. The separatrice pattern and singularity shifts of the Poynting vector unanimously exhibit a differentiable near-field distribution in the presence of optical pulling force. A new method is established to calculate the near-field optical force using the differential Poynting vector in the far field. The results obtained provide a clear physical interpretation of the light–matter interaction and manifest the significance of singular optics in manipulating objects.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical perspective of high-order harmonic generation is presented in which transitions between Â¨ quantum Volkov states-stationary solutions to Schrodingerâs equation for an electron interacting with a quantized optical field-are the dominant mechanism for producing radiation. The picture proposed here is one in which the interaction of an intense optical field with an electron forms a photon-electron ââquasiatomââ and the stationary states of this complex can be viewed as the high optical field analog of bound states of an atom. Consequently, although momentum conservation for the overall harmonic generation process requires that an electron eventually return to the parent atom, the electron and fundamental optical field are treated as an isolated system with well-defined energy and momentum. To introduce a secondary photon harmonic field, the matrix element describing the electron-photon field interaction through quantum Volkov states is modified in a perturbative manner. The result is the production of harmonic photons by VolkovâVolkov-state transitions, a process which has no classical counterpart. The generation of odd harmonics of the fundamental field and the requirement that the final state of the electron be the initial bound state of the atom follow directly from the theory. A clear connection between harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization ATI is drawn by maintaining the discrete, nonzero energies of photoelectrons injected into the driving optical field by ATI. For experiments in which the laser pulse width is Õ¿100-150 fs, only the lowest ATI photoelectron orders contribute significantly to harmonic generation, whereas higher-energy electrons escape from the parent atom during the pulse risetime. As the duration of the fundamental field is decreased, however, the rapid rise of the field intensity to its peak value effectively traps more energetic photoelectrons, thereby extending the harmonic response to shorter wavelengths. An analytic expression for the transition matrix for the harmonic generation process is derived and is compared with the predictions of semiclassical theory and published experimental results, including harmonic spectra and polarization data.},

Furthermore, the use of binary devices has important applications in acoustics, x-ray optics, and electron beam engineering and is also useful when high optical power is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {We review both theoretical and experimental advances in the recently emerged field of modulated photonic lattices. These artificial periodic dielectric structures provide a powerful tool for the control of the fundamental aspects of light propagation. Photonic lattices are arrays of coupled optical waveguides, where the light propagation becomes effectively discretized. The discretized nature of light propagation gives rise to many new phenomena which are not possible in homogeneous bulk media, such as discrete diffraction and diffraction management, discrete and gap solitons, and discrete surface waves. Photonic lattices also allow one to realize optical analogies of phenomena occurring in other physical contexts, such as the physics of solid state and electron theory. For example, the light propagation in photonic lattices may resemble the motion of electrons in a crystalline lattice of semiconductor materials. Additionally, periodic modulation of a photonic lattice by varying its geometry or refractive index is analogous to applying a bias to control the motion of electrons in a crystalline lattice. An interplay between periodicity and modulation in photonic lattices opens up unique opportunities for tailoring diffraction and dispersion properties of light as well as controlling nonlinear interactions. First, we review the linear effects in the modulated waveguides and waveguide arrays, including optical Bloch oscillations and optical dynamic localization, that are key to the understanding of the modulation-driven diffraction management of light. Then we analyze the effects of array boundaries and defects, and highlight a new type of modulation-induced light localization based on the defect-free surface waves. Finally, we discuss nonlinear properties of the modulated lattices with an emphasis on their great potential for all-optical beam shaping and switching.},

Differences that arise between the two approaches for numerical calculations involving a finite set of discrete modes are also pointed out. The formalism is illustrated with an in-depth discussion of the explicit solution for a single-photon pulse, of arbitrary shape and detuning, incident on a cavity containing a two-level atom.},

  Abstract                 = {Let $ L$ be the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group or, what is the same, of the group $ SL(2,C)$. We denote by $ L_k$ the Lie algebra of its maximal compact subgroup, that is, of $ SU(2)$. Let $ M_i$ be the finite-dimensional irreducible $ L_k$ modules (the finite-dimensional representations of $ L_k$). Consider an $ L$-module $ M$. The authors call $ M$ a Harish-Chandra module if, regarded as $ L_k$-module, it can be written as a sum $\displaystyle M=\bigoplus_iM_i$ of finite-dimensional irreducible $ L_k$modules $ M_i$. Here, for each $ M_{i_0}$, only finitely many $ L_k$-submodules equivalent to $ M_{i_0}$ are supposed to occur in the decomposition of $ M$. A Harish-Chandra module is called indecomposable if it cannot be decomposed into the direct sum of $ L$-modules. In this paper the indecomposable Harish-Chandra modules over $ L$ are completely described. We find that there are two types of indecomposable Harish-Chandra modules. The modules of the first type are the non-singular Harish-Chandra modules and are defined by the following invariants: an integer $ 2l_0$ ($ l_0\geq0$), a complex number $ l_1$, and an integer $ n$. The first two of these invariants are already known as invariants of the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group (see [2]). The case of non-singular modules has been investigated earlier by Zhelobenko [3] from a somewhat different approach. The case of singular Harish-Chandra modules is of the greatest interest. The solution of this problem reduces to a non-trivial problem of linear algebra, which is investigated in detail in Chapter 2. The invariants of singular indecomposable modules are, as before, numbers $ l_0$, $ l_1$, $ l_0\ge0$, $ 2l_0$ integral and $ 2l_0-\vert l_1\vert$ integral. However, instead of the one additional invariant $ n$, there are now more invariants. Two types of singular modules are possible: those of the first and those of the second kind. Singular modules of the first kind are characterized, in addition to the invariants $ l_0$ and $ l_1$, by a sequence of integers of arbitrary length. Singular indecomposable modules of the second kind are characterized by the following collection of invariants: the numbers $ l_0$, $ l_1$ given above, a set of integers $ j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_k$, an integer $ q$, and a further arbitrary complex parameter $ \mu$. The presence of this parameter is particularly interesting, because it indicates the possibility of deforming an indecomposable module with $ l_0$ and $ l_1$ fixed. The problems of linear algebra that are used in establishing the facts set out above are of independent interest in that the authors develop and use the apparatus of MacLane's theory of linear relations [4].},

Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct.

Motivated by the success of single-cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, the focus has recently shifted to the exploration of the rich physics promised by strongly correlated quantum-optical systems in multicavity and extended photonic media9-14 . Even though most cavity quantum electrodynamics structures are inherently dissipative, most of the early work on strongly correlated photonic systems has assumed cavity structures where losses are essentially negligible. Here we investigate a dissipative quantum-optical system that consists of two coherently driven linear optical cavities connected through a central cavity with a single-photon nonlinearity (an optical analogue of the Josephson interferometer). The interplay of tunnelling and interactions is analysed in the steady state of the system, when a dynamical equilibrium between driving and losses is established. Strong photonic correlations can be identified through the suppression of Josephson-like oscillations of the light emitted from the central cavity as the nonlinearity is increased. In the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear waveguides, we show that photon-correlation measurements would provide a unique probe of the crossover to the strongly correlated regime.},

We demonstrate an integrated photon-number-resolving detector, operating in the telecom band at 1550 nm, employing an evanescently coupled design that allows it to be placed at arbitrary locations within a planar circuit. Up to five photons are resolved in the guided optical mode via absorption from the evanescent field into a tungsten transition-edge sensor. The detection efficiency is 7.2 Â± 0.5%. The polarization sensitivity of the detector is also demonstrated. Detailed modeling of device designs shows a clear and feasible route to reaching high detection efficiencies.},

  Abstract                 = {The Dirac equation1 successfully merges quantum mechanics with special relativity. It provides a natural description of the electron spin, predicts the existence of antimatter2 and is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. The realm of the Dirac equationârelativistic quantum mechanicsâis considered to be the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects, such as Kleinâs paradox3 and âZitterbewegungâ, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle4. These and other predicted phenomena are key fundamental examples for understanding relativistic quantum effects, but are difficult to observe in real particles. In recent years, there has been increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects using different physical set-ups5â11, in which parameter tunability allows access to different physical regimes. Here we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion7 set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure the particle position as a function of time and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positiveand negative-energy spinor states, as well as the crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

Measurement and reconstruction of the particle wave packet enables a frame-by-frame visualization of the scattering processes.

On the N -particle quantum level, adding an additional harmonic confinement leads to a simple signature to distinguish quantum superpositions from statistical mixtures. While the nonlinear character of the GPE does not allow quantum superpositions, the splitting of GPE solitons takes place only partially. When the potential strength is increased, the fraction of the soliton which is transmitted or reflected jumps noncontinuously. We explain these jumps via energy conservation and interpret them as indications for quantum superpositions on the N -particle level.

  Abstract                 = {Spin-1 systems, in comparison to spin-1/2 systems, offer a better security for encoding and transferring quantum information, primarily due to their larger Hilbert spaces. Superconducting artificial atoms possess multiple energy levels, thereby being capable of emulating higher-spin systems. Here I consider a one-dimensional lattice of nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems, and devise a scheme to transfer an arbitrary qutrit state (a state encoded in a three-level quantum system) across the chain. I assume adjustable couplings between adjacent transmons, derive an analytic constraint for the control pulse, and show how to satisfy the constraint to achieve a high-fidelity state transfer under current experimental conditions. My protocol thus enables enhanced quantum communication and information processing with promising superconducting qutrits.},

  Abstract                 = {A projection operator is defined in terms of coset representatives and “coset harmonics.” This operator is then used to construct fully symmetrized states describing N identical two-level atoms. The properties and quantum numbers of the symmetrized states are fully discussed. Fully symmetrized and labeled states for N identical 3 (or r) level atoms are constructed by a natural extension of this procedure. The interaction Hamiltonian, which describes transitions in an r-level atom, is constructed from the shift operators in the algebra of SU(r). When each of the N identical atoms “sees” the same field dependence, transitions are only allowed between energy eigenstates occurring within the same SU(r) unitary irreducible representation. Physical dispersion of the particles out of the coherence region of the field leads to “leakage” out of an SU(r) representation. If each two-level atom evolves from the ground state under the same field dependence, the total system state is a coherent superposition of bases belonging to the fully symmetric representation {N = 2J}2. These states exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the surface of a unit sphere. They are therefore called Bloch states. The properties of Bloch states are derived and are seen to resemble the properties of coherent photon states. The connection is made manifest by a group contraction process. All properties of Glauber states can be constructed by contraction from the corresponding properties of the Bloch states. The states corresponding to N-identical r-level particles evolving under a coherent field are constructed in the same way. These states exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the coset space , which is a Riemannian-symmetric space. The eigenstate expansions, inner products, eigenvalue equations, and uncertainty relations for these states are derived. More generally, systems of N identical (p + q) level atoms, evolving from the lowest q levels under a coherent field, are described by states existing in 1 - 1 correspondence with Riemannian symmetric space . The properties of these spaces are used to give a geometric analytic interpretation to these coherent atomic states.},

The energy spectra of the two systems are identical, as are all configurational probability distributions, but the momentum distributions are quite different. The general theory is illustrated by application to the special case of impenetrable point particles; the one-one correspondence between bosons with this particular interaction and completely noninteracting fermions leads to a rigorous solution of this many-boson problem.},

We apply our algorithm to run a numerical comparison between quantum discord and an alternative, computable measure of nonclassical correlations, namely, the geometric discord. We identify the extremally nonclassically correlated two-qubit states according to the (normalized) geometric discord, at a fixed value of the conventional quantum discord.

As the Dirac bra-ket satisfies the axioms of the inner product, powerful mathematical tools of functional analysis for the energy calculation of the optical systems are used. The main equations and principles of radiometry (the principle of reversibility and Maxwellâs principle) are reformulated from the concept âthroughputâ into the concept âDirac bra-ket.â For generalization of Maxwellâs principle to the class of quasi-homogeneous sources the concept of âeffective stopsâ is introduced.},

In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

The second involves expanding the field in the set of plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell equations in the vacuum. The relation between the two quantization schemes is discussed in the framework of the scattering theory that connects them. The methods presented are used to show that various field components within a dielectric medium may be either superfluctuant or subfluctuant relative to their fundamental uncertainties in the vacuum. These alterations of the fluctuation properties of the fields are shown to lead to changes in the spontaneous emission rates for both electric and magnetic dipole transitions of excited atoms within or near dielectric media.

In this new technique for mechanical manipulation of atoms, spontaneous emission is suppressed since the atoms evolve in a "dark" state that follows the light field. This means that thephase coherence of the atom is preserved so that this technique is useful in the realization of coherent atomic beam splitters and mirrors. Our experimental results are in good agreement with optical Bloch equation calculations},

Here we demonstrate that, in multimode cavities, crystallization involves the spontaneous breaking of a continuous translational symmetry, through a variant of Brazovskii’s transition, thus paving the way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, such as dislocations, frustration, glassiness and even supersolidity, in ultracold atomic settings, where quantum effects have a dominant role.We apply a functional-integral formalism to explore the role of fluctuations in this correlated many-body system, to calculate their effect on the threshold for ordering, and to determine their imprint on the correlations of the light emitted from the cavity.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to study the realization theory of quantum linear systems. It is shown that for a general quantum linear system its controllability and observability are equivalent and they can be checked by means of a simple matrix rank condition. Based on controllability and observability a specific realization is proposed for general quantum linear systems in which an uncontrollable and unobservable subspace is identified. When restricted to the passive case, it is found that a realization is minimal if and only if it is Hurwitz stable. Computational methods are proposed to find the cardinality of minimal realizations of a quantum linear passive system. It is found that the transfer function G(s) of a quantum linear passive system can be written as a fractional form in terms of a matrix function Σ(s); moreover, G(s) is lossless bounded real if and only if Σ(s) is lossless positive real. A type of realization for multi-input–multi-output quantum linear passive systems is derived, which is related to its controllability and observability decomposition. Two realizations, namely the independent-oscillator realization and the chain-mode realization, are proposed for single-input–single-output quantum linear passive systems, and it is shown that under the assumption of minimal realization, the independent-oscillator realization is unique, and these two realizations are related to the lossless positive real matrix function Σ(s).},

The novel optical element is characterized with both coherent and incoherent light, and its behavior is compared with that of a classical axicon. While the fraxicon exhibits a strong interference pattern in the on-axis intensity distribution, it can be smoothed out when using broadband light, partial spatial coherence light, or by period randomization. As inexpensive, compact/lightweight, and low-absorption elements, fraxicons may find applications in imaging, illumination, and situations where low absorption and dispersion are important.},

Ideally, this permissible coexistence of quantum states, as defined on any degree of freedom, whether spin, frequency or spatial, can be used to fully exploit the information capacity of the associated physical system. In quantum optics, single photons are the quanta of light, and their coherence properties allow them to establish entangled superpositions between a large number of channels, making them favourable for realizations of quantum information processing schemes. In particular, single-photon W-states (that is, states exhibiting a uniform distribution of the photons across multiple modes) represent a class of multipartite maximally-entangled quantum states that are highly robust to dissipation. Here, we report on the generation and verification of single-photon W-states involving up to 16 spatial modes, and exploit their underlying multi-mode superposition for the on-chip generation of genuine random numbers.}

Many adiabatic schemes have also been implemented in optical waveguide structures. Recently there has been increasing interest in the inﬂuence of decay and absorption, and their engineering applications. Here it is shown that even a small decay can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the dynamical behavior of a system, above and beyond a mere change of the overall norm. In particular, a small decay can lead to a breakdown of adiabatic transfer schemes, even when both the spectrum and the eigenfunctions are only sightly modiﬁed. This is demonstrated for the generalization of a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage scheme that has recently been implemented in optical waveguide structures. Here the question how an additional absorption in either the initial or the target waveguide inﬂuences the transfer property of the scheme is addressed. It is found that the scheme breaks down for small values of the absorption at a relatively sharp threshold, which can be estimated by simple analytical arguments.},

  Abstract                 = {The relation between classical and quantum mechanical integrability is investigated for a boson mode coupled to a two-level system. Different semi-classical approximations of this system are considered which are obtained by (i) factorization of expectation values of the two-state variable and the boson, (ii) making a WKB-type approximation, (iii) replacing the boson by a classical field of constant amplitude and fixed frequency and (iv) putting the boson into a self-consistent coherent state. The results vary considerably and include cases of non-integrable and integrable classical dynamics. Quantum mechanically the system is found to satisfy a criterion of quantum mechanical integrability, which we formulate, but the separated Hamiltonian of the boson alone does not have a well-defined classical limit. Numerical results for the energy spectrum and expectation values are obtained, which show a high degree of regularity but also display overlapping avoided crossings usually associated with non-integrable Hamiltonians. The exact dynamics of the occupation probabilities of the two levels is also analysed numerically. The dependence of quantum mechanical recurrence effects (in quantum optics known as revivals) on coupling strength, frequency detuning and initial conditions is studied. The revivals are found to disappear in the case of strong coupling. The Fourier spectra of the dynamical expectation values are also calculated},

Here we describe an optical system that exhibits strongly correlated dynamics on a mesoscopic scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single twolevel atom in the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our results predict that at zero temperature the system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator (excitations localized on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalized across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Moreover, the ability to couple light to and from individual cavities of this system could be useful in the realization of tuneable quantum simulators and other quantum-mechanical devices.},

  Abstract                 = {In this thesis I report on experiments that enter a new regime in the many body physics of ultracold atomic gases. A Bose-Einstein condensate is loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice potential formed by a standing wave laser light field. In this novel quantum system we have been able to both realize a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator, and to observe the collapse and revival of a macroscopic matter wave field. Quantum phase transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations and occur, even at zero temperature, as the relative strength of two competing energy terms in the underlying Hamiltonian is varied across a critical value. In the first part of this work I report on the observation of such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. In the superfluid ground state, each atom is spread-out over the entire lattice, whereas in the Mott insulating state, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites. We observed the reversible transition between those states and detected the gap in the excitation spectrum of the Mott insulator. A Bose-Einstein condensate is usually described by a macroscopic matter wave field. However, a quantized field underlies such a âclassicalâ matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate. The striking behavior of ultracold matter due to the field quantization and the nonlinear interactions between the atoms is the focus of the second part of this work. The matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate is observed to undergo a series of collapses and revivals as time evolves. Furthermore, we show that the collisions between individual pairs of atoms lead to a fully coherent collisional phase shift in the corresponding many-particle state, which is a crucial cornerstone of proposed novel quantum computation schemes with neutral atoms. With these experiments we enter a new field of physics with ultracold quantum gases. In this strongly correlated regime, interactions between atoms dominate the behavior of the many-body system such that it can no longer be described by the usual theories for weakly interacting Bose gases. This novel quantum system offers the unique possibility to experimentally address fundamental questions of modern solid state physics, atomic physics, quantum optics, and quantum information.},

This crossover between BCS-type superfluidity and the BEC limit has long been of theoretical interest, motivated in part by the discovery of high-temperature superconductors1â10.

A variety of tools suitable for tackling the quantum dynamics of explicitly time-dependent Schro¬ dinger equations are introduced. On the other hand, a real-time path integral approach to the dynamics of a tunneling particle embedded in a thermal environment turns out to be a powerful method to treat in a rigorous and systematic way the combined e¤ects of dissipation and driving.

  Abstract                 = {We study a generalized Dicke model, as recently realized in an atomic quantum gas experiment, describing the collective interaction of N two-level atoms with a single cavity mode. The model takes account of dissipation of the cavity field, and includes a nonlinear atom–photon coupling, not present in the conventional Dicke model. We extend previous theoretical investigations of a semiclassical model by including all quantum effects and considering finite atom number N. Our results show good agreement between quantum expectation values and the semiclassical model as N is increased, but also show exotic behaviour for the corresponding quantum state as the nonlinear atom–photon coupling is varied. We consider the cavity-field Wigner function, the atomic Q-function for the collective spin, and the entanglement between the cavity mode and the spin.},

In both cases, the tunneling rate is enhanced, compared with the unperturbed value. This is confirmed by our numerical results. For driving frequencies in the range of the bare tunnel splitting novel types of tunneling behaviour occur, including localization of the wave packet in one of the wells (coherent destruction of tunneling).

This theme, which Jaynes and Cummings emphasized in several ways, is the key role that must be assigned to radiative back reaction in quantum radiation dynamics. Its consequences are well known in subjects related to cavity quantum electrodynamics, and its influence on optical pulse evolution theory is equally strong. Here we provide a new solitonic extension of the radiation reaction theme to short-pulse broad-bandwidth propagation theory. We report a single formula encapsulating a three-pulse scenario in which the stable imprint of signal-pulse coherence, placed in an atomic medium at a predictable location by an initial pulse pair, is subsequently transferred by a third pulse to a different location. This is analysed by reference to our new analytic solution of the nonlinearly coupled density matrix equations that incorporate the radiation reaction fields obtained from the Maxwell equations for the pulses in the atomic medium.},

However, the prescription of incorporating the momentum operator into the Hamiltonian, in some cases does not give the correct form of the Hamiltonian operator. In the present article, the author finds exactly how to incorporate the total momentum operatorpg~ = -ih O/Oq~ into the generalized classical Hamiltonian to get the correct quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator for all cases.

If one wishes to find the correct representation of the generalized momentum operator, he finds the Hermitian part of the operator --ih O/0q, where q is the generalized coordinate. There are interesting philosophical implications involved in this: It is like saying that a physical structure is composed of two parts, one which is real (the measurable quantity) and one which is pure imaginary. However, in order to understand the theoretical generation of the physical structure, one must look at the imaginary part as well as the real part since the sum of these two parts gives the simplified physical theory. That is why we can choose the total generalized momentum operator as simply --ih O/~q, but in order to arrive at the "measurable" momentum operator, we must choose the real (Hermitian) part, the other part being anti-Hermitian (corresponding to pure imaginary eigenvalues). We also discuss the operator Jbrm of the generalized Hamiltonian and show that the primary focus in developing fundamental concepts and prescriptions in quantum mechanics should be on the generalized momenta rather than on the Hamiltonian.},

When the mirror is weakly coupled to the cavity mode, we find that the driven cavity field can effectively perform as a squeezed-vacuum reservoir for the movable mirror via utilizing the completely destructive interference of quantum noise. Efficient transfer of squeezing from the light to the movable mirror occurs, irrespective of the ratio between the cavity damping rate and the mechanical frequency. Moreover, when the mirror is moderately coupled to the cavity mode, photonic excitation can preclude the completely destructive interference of quantum noise. As a consequence, the mirror deviates from the ideal squeezed state.},

Ordinary solitons and ones of the gap type being possible, respectively, in the model with constant negative and positive SL, an issue of interest is to find solitons alternating, in the case of the low-frequency modulation, between shapes of both types, across the zero-SL point. We find such alternate solitons and identify their stability regions in the 2D and 1D models. Three types of the dynamical regimes are distinguished: stable, unstable, and semi-stable. In the latter case, the soliton sheds off a conspicuous part of its initial norm before relaxing to a stable regime. In the 2D case, the threshold (minimum number of atoms) necessary for the existence of the alternate solitons is essentially higher than its counterparts for the ordinary and gap solitons in the static model. In the 1D model, the alternate solitons are also found only above a certain threshold, while the static 1D models have no threshold. In the 1D case, stable antisymmetric alternate solitons are found too. Additionally, we consider a possibility to apply the variational approximation (VA) to the description of stationary gap solitons, in the case of constant positive SL. It predicts the solitons in the first finite bandgap very accurately, and does it reasonably well in the second gap too. In higher bands, the VA predicts a border between tightly and loosely bound solitons.},

The meaning and advantages of such a decoupling treatment are carefully discussed.},

The review is preceded by a brief historical survey of the developments of RMT and of localization theory since their inception. We emphasize the concepts common to the above-mentioned fields as well as the great diversity of RMT. In view of the universality of RMT, we suggest that the current development signals the emergence of a new statistical mechanics: Stochasticity and general symmetry requirements lead to universal laws not based on dynamical principles.},

Analytical expressions are given for valid in the long- and shor-time limits as compared with the renormalized frequency of the TLS. It is shown that other correlation functions depend sensitively on the nature of the high-energy cutoff of the environment. Thermodynamic functions, like the susceptibility to a bias potential and the correction to the specific heat of the environment, are also calculated.

These relatiosn were obtained through well-known equivalences between Fermi and Bose operators in one dimension. The fermionic Hamiltonians correspond to (a) a TLS coupled linearlu with a fermionic bath, (b) the resonan-level model, and (c) the anisotropic Kondo model. For the first Hamiltonian we reobtain and discuss the relationship between the dimensionless dissipation coefficiente a and the phase shift of the fermions. The resonant-level model allows us to study the properties of the TLS for values of a around 1/2. At a=1/2 the model reduces to the Tolouse limit, where the Hamiltonian is exactly solubre. A pure exponential decay is obtained for the relaxation of P(t), given that for t<0 the system is known to be localizaed in one of the two states. The comparison with the Kondo model gives the long-time-limit behavior of the system for 1/2 < a < 1 and provides connection between universal numbers obtained previously for the spin-boson Hamiltonian and the Kondo model.},

The DeutschâJozsa algorithm has been realized experimentally using bulk nuclear magnetic resonance techniques3,4, employing nuclear spins as quantum bits (qubits). In contrast, the ion trap processor utilises5 motional and electronic quantum states of individual atoms as qubits, and in principle is easier to scale to many qubits. Experimental advances in the latter area include the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate6, the entanglement of four ions7, quantum state engineering8 and entanglement-enhanced phase estimation9. Here we exploit techniques10,11 developed for nuclear magnetic resonance to implement the DeutschâJozsa algorithm on an ion-trap quantum processor, using as qubits the electronic and motional states of a single calcium ion. Our ion-based implementation of a full quantum algorithm serves to demonstrate experimental procedures with the quality and precision required for complex computations, confirming the potential of trapped ions for quantum computation.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of retardation in the entanglement dynamics of two distant atoms interacting with a multimode field of a ring cavity is discussed. The retardation is associated with a finite time required for light to travel between the atoms located at a finite distance and between the atoms and the cavity boundaries. We explore features in the concurrence indicative of retardation and show how these features evolve depending on the initial state of the system, distance between the atoms, and the number of modes to which the atoms are coupled. In particular, we consider the short-time and the long-time dynamics for both the multi- and subwavelength distances between the atoms. It is found that the retardation effects can qualitatively modify the entanglement dynamics of the atoms not only at multi- but also at subwavelength distances. We follow the temporal evolution of the concurrence and find that at short times of the evolution the retardation induces periodic sudden changes of entanglement. To analyze where the entanglement lies in the space spanned by the state vectors of the system, we introduce the collective Dicke states of the atomic system that explicitly account for the sudden changes as a periodic excitation of the atomic system to the maximally entangled symmetric state. At long times, the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence that resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the Jaynes-Cummings model. In addition, we identify parameter values and initial conditions at which the atoms remain separable or are entangled without retardation during the entire evolution time, but exhibit the phenomena of sudden birth and sudden death of entanglement when the retardation is included.},

The system, e.g., an ion or ultracold atom trapped in a potential, shows no spatial periodicity, but it is driven by a time-dependent field coupling highly nonlinearly to one of its degrees of freedom (e.g., ∼qn). The band structure in quasienergy arises as a consequence of the n-fold discrete periodicity in phase space induced by this driving field. We propose an explicit model to realize such a phase space crystal and analyze its band structure in the frame of a tight-binding approximation. The phase space crystal opens new ways to engineer energy band structures, with the added advantage that its properties can be changed in situ by tuning the driving field’s parameters.},

By constructing the partition function as a path integral, the analytical and numerical solutions are presented. On the mean-field level, it is shown that the polariton condensation can occur and the Kerr nonlinearity affects the character of the polariton condensate. As the nonlinear coefficient increases, the condensate evolves from more photon-like to more exciton-like. Although the photon nonlinearity gives rise to a chemical potential greater than the photon energy, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum is still fully gapped. For the condensate collective excitations, the nonlinearity destroys the Goldstone modes and mixes the phase modes with the amplitude modes, resulting four non-zero-frequency collective modes. In addition, the influence of the photon-exciton detuning on the polariton condensate is also discussed.},

Although this kind of nonlinearity o is quite general, we focus on a realistic implementation involving cold atoms loaded in a hollow-core optical fiber, where the atomic system provides a tunable nonlinearity that can be large even at a single-photon level. In particular, we show that when the interaction between photons is effectively repulsive, the transmission of multiphoton components of the field is suppressed. This leads to antibunching of the transmitted light and indicates that the system acts as a single-photon switch. On the other hand, in the case of attractive interaction, the system can exhibit either antibunching or bunching, which is in stark contrast to semiclassical calculations. We show that the bunching behavior is related to the resonant excitation of bound states of photons inside the system.},

  Abstract                 = {The generation, manipulation and fundamental understanding of entanglement lies at the very heart of quantum mechanics. Entangled particles are non-interacting but are described by a common wavefunction; consequently, individual particles are not independent of each other and their quantum properties are inextricably interwoven1â3. The intriguing features of entanglement become particularly evident if the particles can be individually controlled and physically separated. However, both the experimental realization and characterization of entanglement become exceedingly difficult for systems with many particles. The main difficulty is to manipulate and detect the quantum state of individual particles as well as to control the interaction between them. So far, entanglement of four ions4 or five photons5 has been demonstrated experimentally. The creation of scalable multiparticle entanglement demands a non-exponential scaling of resources with particle number. Among the various kinds of entangled states, the âW stateâ6â8 plays an important role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even under particle loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum information processing9 and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report the scalable and deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-particle entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain the maximum possible information on these states by performing full characterization via state tomography10, using individual control and detection of the ions. A detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine. The availability of such multiparticle entangled states, together with full information in the form of their density matrices, creates a test-bed for theoretical studies of multiparticle entanglement. Independently, âGreenbergerâHorneâZeilingerâ entangled states11 with up to six ions have been created and analysed in Boulder12.},

Our setup provides the basic toolbox from atomic physics for coherent manipulation, preparation, and measurement of micromechanical and nanomechanical oscillators.},

The attenuation and phase-shift filters are represented, respectively, by the three-parameter rotation subgroup and the three-parameter Lorentz group for two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. The Lorentz group has another three-parameter subgroup, which is like the two-dimensional Euclidean group. Optical filters that may have this Euclidean symmetry are discussed in detail. It is shown that the Jones-matrix formalism can be extended to some of the nonorthogonal polarization coordinate systems within the framework of the Lorentz-group representation.},

The relative phase accumulated by various adiabatic states as they evolve along different paths is tailored to show the existence of quantum interference effects.

Substantial progress has been achieved with arrays of Josephson junctions and cold atoms in optical lattices, where detailed control over collective properties is feasible, but addressing individual sites remains a challenge. Here we show that a system of polaritons held in an array of resonant optical cavitiesâ which could be realized using photonic crystals or toroidal microresonatorsâcan form a strongly interacting manybody system showing quantum phase transitions, where individual particles can be controlled and measured.

For the or Dicke models (k is an integer), the G-function, which is only an energy dependent determinant, is derived in a transparent manner. The regular spectrum is completely and uniquely given by stable zeros of the G-function. The closed-form exceptional eigenvalues are also derived. The level distribution controlled by the pole structure of the G-functions suggests non-integrability for model at any finite coupling in the sense of recent criteria found in the literature.

The BFORT is composed of a blue-detuned Laguerre-Gaussian LG1 beam and a red-detuned Gaussian beam. The 0 atomic oscillation frequency measurement shows that the effective trapping dimension is much sharper than that from a diffraction-limited microscopic objective. Theory shows that the added scattering rate due to imposing blue-detuned light is negligible when the temperature of the single atoms is close to ground state temperature. By carrying out sub-Doppler cooling, the mean energy of single atoms trapped in the BFORT is reduced to 15 Â± 1 Âµ K. The corresponding mean quantum number of radial vibration n is about 1.65, which satisfies the Lamb-Dicke regime. We conclude that the BFORT is a suitable Lamb-Dicke trap for further cooling a single neutral atom down to the ground state and for further application in quantum information processing.},

We show that, in the limit of large N, the Hardy-like proof effectively becomes an all-versus-nothing (or GreenbergerâHorneâZeilinger (GHZ)-like) proof, and the quantum-classical gap of the Bell inequality tends to be the same as that in a three-particle GHZ experiment.

When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity mode1, 2, it is possible to realize important quantum information processing tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this end. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot–cavity system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic crystal nanocavity3, 4, 5 interacting with one, and only one, quantum dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145. The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime. Our observations unequivocally show that quantum information tasks are achievable in solid-state cavity QED.},

Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons1,2, is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically3â5. In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 mmns21. When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence timeT2* of GaAs spin qubits6. Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the experimental observation and a theoretical description of the scattering of free falling dilute thermal clouds of 87Rb atoms by microscopically structured light beams with parabolic-cylindrical symmetry. These structured beams are known in the literature as Weber beams. High-ﬁdelity Weber beams are generated by means of a spatial light modulator and an annular spatial ﬁltering process, which yields a quasipropagationinvariant electromagnetic ﬁeld in the region of interaction with the atom cloud. The dynamics of the atomic density proﬁle and the phase space distribution of the scattered atoms is explored. A natural dynamical variable of Weber modes is the product of the angular momentum along the axis of propagation of the beam with a component of linear momentum perpendicular to that axis. To pave the way of the understanding about the transfer of this variable, we study the evolution of the analogous atomic variable.},

We prove that the time-reversal symmetry of the external ﬁeld is a necessary condition of the degeneracy. We demonstrate the gap opening in the quasienergy spectrum in asymmetrically periodically driven systems.

  Abstract                 = {Concurrence is a widely used entanglement measure of bipartite mixed states. We propose to consider the concurrence as being defined by a quadratic form on the space of self-adjoint operators. The square root of this form determines the values of the concurrence on the pure states, while the values on the mixed states are obtained as the largest convex extension, the convex roof. This viewpoint admits a generalization. Namely, the space of self-adjoint operators and the convex cone of positive semidefinite operators contained therein can be replaced by an arbitrary real vector space containing a convex cone. Then the concurrence is determined on the extreme rays of the cone by the square root of a quadratic form, and on the rest of the cone by the convex roof. We compute this generalized concurrence in the case when the cone is a second order cone. This enables us to compute the concurrence of arbitrary bipartite mixed states of rank 2. As an application, we compute the concurrences of the density matrices of all graphs with two edges or with three edges forming a triangle. We also consider the problem of maximizing the concurrence on the set of mixed states having a fixed spectrum.},

Here we take a different approach and derive a Hamiltonian describing interacting fields from one which contains both field and matter degrees of freedom. The medium is modeled as a collection of two-level atoms, and these interact with the electromagnetic field. The atoms are grouped into effective spins and the the Holstein-Primakoff representation of the spin operators is used to expand them in inverse powers of the total spin. When the lowest order term of the interaction is combined with the free atomic and field Hamiltonians, a Hamiltonian describing a theory of noninteracting polaritons results. When higher order terms are expressed in terms of polariton operators standard nonlinear optical interactions emerge. These are then compared to the results of phenomenological and macroscopic theories. The theory is also used to derive an effective Hamiltonian describing counterpropagating modes in a nonlinear medium},

By now it should be possible to obtain consensus on at least one issue: Are the fundamental constituents ﬁelds or particles? As this paper shows, experiment and theory imply that unbounded ﬁelds, not bounded particles, are fundamental. This is especially clear for relativistic systems, implying that it’s also true of nonrelativistic systems. Particles are epiphenomena arising from ﬁelds. Thus, the Schr€odinger ﬁeld is a space-ﬁlling physical ﬁeld whose value at any spatial point is the probability amplitude for an interaction to occur at that point. The ﬁeld for an electron is the electron; each electron extends over both slits in the two-slit experiment and spreads over the entire pattern; and quantum physics is about interactions of microscopic systems with the macroscopic world rather than just about measurements. It’s important to clarify this issue because textbooks still teach a particles- and measurement-oriented interpretation that contributes to bewilderment among students and pseudoscience among the public. This article reviews classical and quantum ﬁelds, the two-slit experiment, rigorous theorems showing particles are inconsistent with relativistic quantum theory, and several phenomena showing particles are incompatible with quantum ﬁeld theories},

The entanglement can be verified unambiguously by a pump-probe sequence of pulses. In contrast to schemes thatwork in a steady-state regime under a continuous-wave drive, this protocol is not subject to stability requirements that normally limit the strength of achievable entanglement. We investigate the protocolâs performance under realistic conditions, including mechanical decoherence, in full detail.We discuss the relevance of a high mechanical Qf product for entanglement creation and provide a quantitative statement on which magnitude of the Qf product is necessary for a successful realization of the scheme. We determine the optimal parameter regime for its operation and show it to work in current state-of-the-art systems.},

The ordered state, quasi periodic with two frequencies, becomes chaotic when a bifurcation introduces a third frequency at a critical value o a control parameter. This rout evolves from the nonlinear Coulomb coupling of the ion pair's axial and radial motions, displatying frequency loking and hysteresis, which is observed.},

We obtain the Mott-superfluid phase boundary and calculate excitation spectra in the Mott phase using numerical and analytical methods. Including the additional hopping terms leads to a larger Mott phase in the case of trapped ions, and to a smaller Mott phase in the case of stripline resonators, compared to the original model with nearest-neighbor hopping only. The critical hopping for the transition changes by up to about 50 percent in one dimension and by up to about 20 percent in two dimensions.

From mean-field and strongcoupling expansions, the critical properties of the model are expected to be identical to the scalar Bose-Hubbard model. A recent Monte Carlo study of the superfluid density on the square lattice suggested that this does not hold for the fixed-density transition through the Mott lobe tip. Instead, mean-field behavior with a dynamical critical exponent z = 2 was found. We perform large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the critical behavior of the superfluid density and the compressibility. We find z = 1 at the tip of the insulating lobe. Hence the transition falls in the three-dimensional XY universality class, analogous to the Bose-Hubbard model.},

The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the ordert of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10^{-4}.

After recapitulating the ideas underlying Bloch oscillations and Zenerâs formula for interband transitions, the BlochâZener scenario is tested by means of accurate numerical solutions to the time-dependent SchrÂ¨odinger equation. It is shown how two shortcomings of the traditional Zener formula can be removed: the common weak-binding approximation can be circumvented by combining Kohnâs insight into the structure of complex energy bands with the DykhneâDavisâPechukas description of transitions in terms of adiabatic excursions on analytically continued eigenvalue surfaces, and a usually neglected Stokes phenomenon comes into play when accounting for the finite width of the Brillouin zone. Treating BoseâEinstein condensates in optical lattices within the standard mean-field approximation at zero temperature, the ideal BlochâZener scenario turns out to be remarkably stable against the condensateâs nonlinear self-interaction. Yet, under appropriate conditions a Bloch-oscillating GrossâPitaevskii wavepacket reveals characteristic signatures of that nonlinearity, such as sudden phase jumps, slight shifts of the oscillation frequency or non-classical breathing modes. It is suggested that such experimentally detectable signatures will play an important role in future high-precision experiments aiming at the exploration of many-body dynamics in periodic potentials with condensates in optical lattices.},

We concentrate on two different effects that become significant at different levels of anharmonicity. The first is a modification of the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes of the ionsâ normal modes of vibration for multi-ion crystals, resulting from each ion experiencing a different curvature in the potential. In the second effect, which occurs with increased anharmonicity or higher excitation amplitude, amplitude-dependent shifts of the normal-mode frequencies become important. We evaluate normal-mode frequency and amplitude shifts, and comment on the implications for quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. Since the ratio of the anharmonic to harmonic terms typically increases as the ionâelectrode distance decreases, anharmonic effects will become more significant as ion trap sizes are reduced. To avoid unwanted problems, anharmonicities should therefore be taken into account at the design stage of trap development.},

We obtain an exact analytical solution for the system’s quantum mechanical equations of motion, including details about the exchange of the single photon between the cavity mode and the external continuum. The resulting time evolution of the interferometer’s fringe visibility displays interesting new features when the incoming photon’s frequency uncertainty is narrower or comparable to the cavity’s line width—only in the limiting case of much broader-band photon does the result return to that of Marshall et al., but in this case the photon is not very likely to enter the cavity and interact with the mirror, making the experiment less efficient and more susceptible to imperfections. In addition, we show that in the strong-coupling regime, by engineering the incoming photon’s wave function, it is possible to prepare the movable mirror into an arbitrary quantum state of a multidimensional Hilbert space.},

  Abstract                 = {The coupled-mode theory (CMT) for optical waveguides is reviewed, with emphasis on the analysis of coupled optical waveguides. A brief account of the recent development of the CMT for coupled optical waveguides is given. Issues raised in the debates of the 1980's on the merits and shortcomings of the conventional as well as the improved coupled-mode formulations are discussed. The conventional coupled-mode formulations are set up in a simple, intuitive way. The rigorous CMT is established on the basis of a linear superposition of the modes for individual waveguides. The cross-power terms appear logically as a result of modal nonorthogonality. The cross power is necessary for the self-consistency of the CMT for dissimilar waveguides. The nonorthogonal CMT, though more complicated, yields more-accurate results than the conventional orthogonal CMT for most practical applications. It also leads to the prediction of cross talk in directional couplers. The conventional orthogonal CMT is, however, reliably accurate for describing the power coupling between two weakly coupled, nearly identical waveguides. For dissimilar waveguides, a self-consistent orthogonal CMT can be derived by a redefinition of the coupling coefficients, and it predicts the coupling length and therefore the power exchange between the waveguides accurately if the two waveguides are far apart. Three typical coupler configurations-the uniform, the grating-assisted, and the tapered-are examined in detail. The accuracy, scope of validity, limitations, and extensions of the coupled-mode formulations are discussed in conjunction with each configuration. To verify the arguments in the discussions, comparisons with the exact analytical solutions and the rigorous numerical simulations are made.},

  Abstract                 = {Evanescent waves and fields play an important role in microwaves, quantum mechanics, optics and elastic waves. Because electromagnetic waves in waveguides have dispersion characteristics similar to those of a unidimensional de Broglie wave, there is a close analogy between quantum mechanical tunneling and the transition through an attenuating sector of a waveguide. Microwave “evanescent mode” filters, quantummechanical tunneling resonance and optical frustrated total internal reflection filters are compared in light of this analogy. The flowgraph technique and “unit real” function representation are shown to be effective in discussing the interdependence of incident and reflected waves in various locations in multilayered structures. In electrognetic and elastic waves, the role of evanescent waves is significant in the case of incident beams of limited extent. The role of equivalent circuits of transverse resonance is discussed in the context of oscillatory natural modes determining the character of propagating fields.},

  Abstract                 = {An electromagnetic model of a “potential barrier” may be constructed from three sectors of waveguide, two outer sectors being filled with dielectric, the short inner sector air-filled. Using the mathematical analogy between the propagation data of the De Broglie wave and the wave inside a waveguide—above and below cutoff—it is demonstrated that, for a frequency of operation between the cutoff frequencies of the air-filled and the dielectric-filled waveguide, the air-filled section represents the potential barrier region. Thus the described apparatus, the construction of which has been carried out in full detail, enables the modeling of the tunnel effect experimentally and in a quantitative fashion.},

This scheme is based on a microscopic model, in which the medium is represented by a collection of interacting matter fields. We calculate the exact eigenoperators for the coupled system and express the electromagnetic field operators in terms of them. The dielectric constant of the medium is explicitly derived and is shown to satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. We apply these results to treat the propagation of light in dielectrics and obtain simple expressions for the electromagnetic field in the medium in terms of space-dependent creation and annihilation operators. These operators satisfy a set of equal-space commutation relations and obey spatial Langevin equations of evolution. This justifies the use of such operators in phenomenological models in quantum optics. We also obtain two interesting relationships between the group and the phase velocity in dielectrics.},

Varying the spacing l changes the transition amplitudes between the angular momentum levels. We derive an exact diagonalization of the general N-qubit Hamiltonian and, through the N=4 case, demonstrate how the l-dependent operators lead to a denser one-excitation spectrum and a probability redistribution of the eigenstates. Moreover, we show that the variation of l between its two limiting values coincides with the crossover between Frenkel- and Wannier-type excitons in the superconducting qubit chain.},

In fact the decomposition of the field into amplitude and phase factors, and the corresponding definition of the instantaneous frequency, are not unique. The interaction pictures for different decomposition are strictly equivalent, but only as long as approximations are not applied.

A 65, 022308 (2002)] results, our results show that the error depends strongly on the initial state of the qubit. When the initial state of the qubit is the ground state, the error is about 20 times smaller than that of the control started from the excited state, no matter how large N is. This dependency is explained in the context of an exact quantum mechanical description of the pulse area theorem. Using the result, the error accumulation tendency of successive pulse controls is found to be both nonlinear and initial state dependent.},

  Abstract                 = {By driving a dispersively coupled qubit-resonator system, we realize an “impedance-matched” Λ system that has two identical radiative decay rates from the top level and interacts with a semi-infinite waveguide. It has been predicted that a photon input from the waveguide deterministically induces a Raman transition in the system and switches its electronic state. We confirm this through microwave response to a continuous probe field, observing near-perfect (99.7%) extinction of the reflection and highly efficient (74%) frequency down-conversion. These proof-of-principle results lead to deterministic quantum gates between material qubits and microwave photons and open the possibility for scalable quantum networks interconnected with waveguide photons.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent experiments on quantum behavior in microfabricated solid-state systems suggest tantalizing connections to quantum optics. Several of these experiments address the prototypical problem of cavity quantum electrodynamics: a two-level system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator. Such devices may allow the exploration of parameter regimes outside the near-resonance and weak-coupling assumptions of the ubiquitous rotating-wave approximation (RWA), necessitating other theoretical approaches. One such approach is an adiabatic approximation in the limit that the oscillator frequency is much larger than the characteristic frequency of the two-level system. A derivation of the approximation is presented, together with a discussion of its applicability in a system consisting of a Cooper-pair box coupled to a nanomechanical resonator. Within this approximation the time evolution of the two-level-system occupation probability is calculated using both thermal- and coherent-state initial conditions for the oscillator, focusing particularly on collapse and revival phenomena. For thermal-state initial conditions parameter regimes are found in which collapse and revival regions may be clearly distinguished, unlike the erratic evolution of the thermal-state RWA model. Coherent-state initial conditions lead to complex behavior, which exhibits sensitive dependence on the coupling strength and the initial amplitude of the oscillator state. One feature of the regime considered here is that closed-form evaluation of the time evolution may be carried out in the weak-coupling limit, which provides insight into the differences between the thermal- and coherent-state models. Finally, potential experimental observations in solid-state systems, particularly the Cooper-pair box—nanomechanical resonator system, are discussed and found to be promising.},

Here we simulate the emergence of magnetism by implementing a fully connected non-uniform ferromagnetic quantum Ising model using up to 9 trapped 171Yb + ions. By increasing the Ising coupling strengths compared with the transverse field, the crossover from paramagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up, prefacing the expected quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. We measure scalable order parameters appropriate for large systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. As the results are theoretically tractable, this work provides a critical benchmark for the simulation of intractable arbitrary fully connected Ising models in larger systems.},

We derive explicit formulas for the change in the action in several models. Extensive numerical calculations support the theory and demonstrate its universal character.

  Abstract                 = {High-energy photons and other particles carrying nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM) emerge as a new tool in high-energy physics. Recently, it was suggested to generate high-energy photons with nonzero OAM(twisted photons) by the Compton backscattering of twisted optical photons on relativistic electron beams. Twisted electrons in the intermediate energy range have also been demonstrated experimentally; twisted protons and other particles can, in principle, be created in a similar way. Collisions of energetic twisted states can offer a new look at particle properties and interactions. A theoretical description of twisted particle scattering developed previously treated them as pure Bessel states and ran into difficulty when describing the OAM of the final twisted particle at nonzero scattering angles. Here we develop further this formalism by incorporating two additional important features. First, we treat the initial OAM state as a wave packet of a finite transverse size rather than a pure Bessel state. This realistic assumption allows us to resolve the existing controversy between two theoretical analyses for nonforward scattering. Second, we describe the final twisted particle in terms of the orbital helicity: the OAM projection on its average direction of propagation rather than on the fixed reaction axis. Using this formalism, we determine to what extent the twisted state is transferred from the initial to final OAM particle in a generic scattering kinematics. As a particular application, we prove that in the Compton backscattering the orbital helicity of the final photon stays close to the OAM projection of the initial photon.},

  Abstract                 = {A modular systematic analysis of the feasibility of modifying atomic transition rates by tailoring the electromagnetic field of an external coherent light source is presented. The formalism considers both the center of mass and internal degrees of freedom of the atom, and all properties of the field: frequency, angular spectrum, and polarization. General features of recoil effects for internal forbidden transitions are discussed. A comparative analysis of different structured light sources is explicitly worked out. It includes spherical waves, Gaussian beams, Laguerre-Gaussian beams, and propagation invariant beams with closed analytical expressions. It is shown that increments in the order of magnitude of the transition rates for Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams, with respect to those obtained in the paraxial limit, require waists of the order of the wavelength, while propagation invariant modes may considerably enhance transition rates under more favorable conditions. For transitions that can be naturally described as modifications of the atomic angular momentum, this enhancement is maximal (within propagation invariant beams) for Bessel modes, Mathieu modes can be used to entangle the internal and center-of-mass involved states, and Weber beams suppress this kind of transition unless they have a significant component of odd modes. However, if a recoil effect of the transition with an adequate symmetry is allowed, the global transition rate (center of mass and internal motion) can also be enhanced using Weber modes. The global analysis presented reinforces the idea that a better control of the transitions between internal atomic states requires both a proper control of the available states of the atomic center of mass, and shaping of the background electromagnetic field.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong interactions between electrons in a solid material can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, in which suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of interactions rather than a filled Bloch band1. Proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin of many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics2, most notably high-temperature superconductivity3. The Hubbard model4, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice5,6. It is therefore now possible to access this regime with tools developed in atomic physics. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons7, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is identified by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to an increase in atom number, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating regime and the non-interacting regime without changing tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity6,8.},

It is known that the resulting mean force is zero for a motionless mirror, but not for a mirror moving with a non-uniform acceleration. The authors show here that this force results from a motional modification of the field scattering while being associated with the fluctuations of the radiation pressure on a motionless mirror. They consider the case of a scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime and characterize the scattering upon the mirror by frequency dependent transmissivity and reflectivity functions obeying unitarity, causality and high frequency transparency conditions. They derive causal expressions for dissipation and fluctuations and exhibit their relation for any stationary input. They recover the known damping force at the limit of a perfect mirror in vacuum. Finally, they interpret the force as a mechanical signature of the squeezing effect associated with the mirror's motion.}

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the laser cooling of a trapped particle when the discrete nature of the quantum levels must be taken into account. We particularize the equations to the Lamb-Dicke limit when the oscillational amplitude is much less than the optical wavelength. Then the quantum levels are coupled only to the neighbouring ones, and we can also find a small parameter to use for adiabatic elimination of rapidly varying terms. There emerges one rate equation for the probability distribution over the quantum states. The ultimate distribution is found to be of the Planckian type independently of the initial one. We solve the equation generally and obtain the time evolution for an arbitrary initial distribution. In particular we look at an initially thermal, P0isson, or pure state distribution. For the thermal one we find that its shape is preserved during the cooling. The results are discussed.},

The slowly varying quantity in a harmonic trap is then the energy, and a representation based on oscillator eigenstates is used. For large excitation, fast particles, a Fokker-Planck expansion is obtained which is valid when our adiabatic description breaks down. Estimates of the initial cooling rate are given and compared with earlier results. Our treatment requires a large number of oscillator states to be coupled by each one-photon process, and in this limit the diffusion will make the expansion invalid towards the end of the cooling; our physical interpretation is that particles leak out of the trap. The opposite case, the Lamb-Dicke regime, is advantageous for cooling experiments, and then a difference equation replaces the Fokker-Planck equation of the present paper.},

The angular and conditional angular spectra are calculated for an uniaxial crystal optimized for type I SPDC with standard Gaussian pump beams. It is shown that, as the mean value of the magnitude of the transverse wave vector of the pump beam increases, the emission cone is deformed into two non-coaxial cones that touch each other along a line determined by the orientation of the optical axis of the nonlinear crystal. At this location, the conditional spectrum becomes maximal for a pair of photons, one of which is best described by a Gaussian-like photon with a very small transverse wave vector, and the other a Bessel-Gauss photon with a distribution of transverse wave vectors similar in amplitude to that of the incident pump beam. A detailed analysis is then performed of the angular momentum content of SPDC photons by the evaluation of the corresponding transition amplitudes. As a result, we obtain conditions for the generation of heralded single photons which are approximately propagation invariant and have orbital angular momentum. A discussion is given about the difficulties in the interpretation of the results in terms of conservation of optical orbital angular momentum along the vector normal to the crystal surface. The angular spectra and the conditional angular spectra are successfully compared with available experimental data recently reported in the literature.}

Linear and nonlinear phase effects are numerically studied for rectangular and sinc-shaped pulses. Furthermore, analytical results are obtained in the limits of weak fields, as well as strong dephasing, and by nearly degenerate perturbation theory for sinusoidal excitation. The results show that the phase-sensitive inversion in the ideal two-level system is a promising route for constructing carrier-envelope phase detectors.},

In this article, we review the properties of light in coupled optical waveguides that support specific energy spectra, with or without the effects of disorder, that are well-described by a Hermitian tight-binding model. We show that with a judicious choice of the initial wave packet, this system displays the characteristics of a quantum particle, including transverse photonic transport and localization, and that of a classical particle. We extend the analysis to non-Hermitian, parity and time-reversal (PT ) symmetric Hamiltonians which physically represent waveguide arrays with spatially separated, balanced absorption or amplification. We show that coupled waveguides are an ideal candidate to simulate PT -symmetric Hamiltonians and the transition from a purely real energy spectrum to a spectrum with complex conjugate eigenvalues that occurs in them.},

The impurity is coupled to the Bose gas and confined to a separate tilted lattice. The precise nature of the transport of the impurity is specific to the excitation spectrum of the Bose gas, which allows one to measure properties of the Bose gas nondestructively, in principle, by observing the impurity; herewe focus on the spatial and momentum distributions of the impurity as well as its reduced density matrix. For instance, we show it is possible to determine whether the Bose gas is commensurately filled as well as the bandwidth and gap in its excitation spectrum. Moreover, we show that the impurity acts as a witness to the crossover of its environment from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime, i.e., from a superfluid to a Mott insulator or Tonks-Girardeau lattice gas, and the effects on the impurity in both of these strongly interacting regimes are clearly distinguishable. Finally, we find that the spatial coherence of the impurity is related to its propagation through the Bose gas.},

We first consider the indirect interaction between two such nonlinear oscillators mediated by a third, linear oscillator and show that this leads to a time-varying entanglement of the oscillators, the entanglement being strongly influenced by the nonlinear oscillator dynamics. In the presence of dissipation, the role of nonlinearity is strongly manifested in the steady-state dynamics of the indirectly coupled anharmonic oscillators. We further illustrate the effect of nonlinearities by studying the coupling between an electromagnetic field in a cavity and one movable mirror which is modelled as a nonlinear oscillator. For this case, we present a full analytical treatment, which is valid in a regime where both the nonlinearity and the coupling due to radiation pressure are weak. We show that, without the need of any conditional measurements on the cavity field, the state of the movable mirror is non-classical as a result of the combined effect of the intrinsic nonlinearity and the radiation-pressure coupling. This interaction is also shown to be responsible for squeezing the movable mirror’s position quadrature beyond the minimum uncertainty state even when the mirror is initially prepared in its ground state},

  Abstract                 = {The transverse localization of light in a disordered photonic lattice with a central defect is analyzed numerically. The effect of different input beam widths on various regimes of Anderson localization is investigated. The inclusion of a defect enhances the localization of both narrow and broad beams, as compared to the lattice with no defect. But, in the case of a broad beam a higher disorder level is needed to reach the same localization as for a narrow input beam. It is also investigated how the transverse localization of light in such geometries depends on both the strength of disorder and the strength of nonlinearity in the system. While in the linear regime the localization is most pronounced in the lattice with the defect, in the nonlinear regime this is not the case.},

Two cases are described: the squeezing formation in the evolution of the system around the stable point, and in the short-time evolution in the vicinity of an unstable point. The latter is shown to produce highly squeezed states on very short times. On the basis of a semiclassical approximation to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we are able to predict the amount of squeezing, its scaling with N , and the speed of coherent spin formation with simple analytical formulas which successfully describe the numerical Bose-Hubbard results. This method of producing highly squeezed spin states in systems of ultracold atoms is compared to other standard methods in the literature.},

The effective field amplitudes of the multiple photon transitions are found to have a Bessel-function-like dependence on the radio frequency amplitude. The behavior of the magnetization vector during a bichromatic pulse is illustrated by using classical equations of motion. The theoretically predicted effects are verified experimentally.

Partial coherence is commonly attributed to underlying fluctuations originating at the source or arising upon passage through a random medium. A less acknowledged source of uncertainty (partial coherence) stems from the act of ignoring a degree of freedom of a beam when observing another degree of freedom coupled to (or classically entangled with) it. We demonstrate here that Bell’s measure, which is commonly used in tests of quantum non-locality, may be used as a quantitative tool in classical optical coherence to delineate native incoherence associated with statistical fluctuations from correlation- (or, entanglement-) based incoherence. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the concepts recently developed in quantum information science to classical optical coherence theory and optical signal processing.},

We show that these accelerating beams are self-healing, analyze their properties, and find the new class of accelerating breathers: self-bending beams of periodically oscillating shapes. Finally, we emphasize that in their scalar form, these beams are the exact solutions for nondispersive accelerating wave packets of the most common wave equation describing time-harmonic waves.

  Abstract                 = {Quantum information transfer is an important part of quantum information processing. Several proposals for quantum information transfer along linear arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits or spins were made recently. Perfect transfer was shown to exist in two models with specifically designed strongly inhomogeneous couplings. We show that perfect transfer occurs in an entire class of chains, including systems whose nearestneighbor couplings vary only weakly along the chain. The key to these observations is the Jordan-Wigner mapping of spins to noninteracting lattice fermions that display perfectly periodic dynamics if the singleparticle energy spectrum is appropriate. After a half-period of that dynamics, any state is transformed into its mirror image with respect to the center of the chain. The absence of fermion interactions preserves these features at an arbitrary temperature and allows for the transfer of nontrivially entangled states of several spins or qubits.},

Various localization-related phenomena, such as the periodic revival of a propagating Anderson-localized beam, are easily explained in modal language. We characterize the localization strength by the average width of the guided modes and carry out a detailed analysis of localization behavior as a function of the optical and geometrical parameters of the disordered lattice. We also show that in order to obtain a minimum average mode width, the average width of the individual random sites in the disordered lattice must be larger than the wavelength of the light by approximately a factor of two or more, and the optimum site width for the maximum localization depends on the design parameters of the disordered lattice.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce stripe-like quasi-nondiffracting lattices that can be generated via spatial spectrum engineering. The complexity of the spatial shapes of such lattices and the distance of their almost diffractionless propagation depend on the width of their ring-like spatial spectrum. Stripelike lattices are extended in one direction and are localized in the orthogonal one, thereby creating either straight or curved in any desired fashion optically-induced channels that may be used for optical trapping, optical manipulation, or optical lattices for quantum and nonlinear optics applications. As an illustrative example, here we show their potential for spatial soliton control. Complex networks consisting of several intersecting or joining stripe-like lattices suited to a particular application may also be constructed.},

The dynamics of light in such lattices crucially depends on the ratio of the switching length for the straight segments of each coupler and the longitudinal lattice period. Depending on the longitudinal period, one can achieve either beam rectification when the input light propagates at a fixed angle across the structure without diffractive broadening or dynamic localization when the initial intensity distribution is periodically restored after each longitudinal period. Importantly, the transition between these two different propagation regimes can be achieved by tuning only gain and losses acting in the system, provided that the PT symmetry remains unbroken. The impact of Kerr nonlinearity is also discussed.},

Interestingly, these protocols are characterized by sharp transitions between Majorana motion at maximal and minimal velocities.We find that these so-called bang-bang protocols can minimize the nonadiabatic transitions of the system by orders of magnitude in comparison with naive protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {The question how to quantize a classical system where an angle â¸ is one of the basic canonical variables has been controversial since the early days of quantum mechanics. The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or discontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to replace â¸ by the smooth periodic functions cos â¸ and sin â¸. In the case of the canonical pair â¸ , pâ¸, where pâ¸ is the orbital angular momentum OAM, the phase space Sâ¸,pâ¸ = â¸ à· R mod 2â² , pâ¸ à· R has the global topological structure S1 Ï« R of a cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the three functions cos â¸ , sin â¸, and pâ¸ obey the Lie algebra of the Euclidean group E2 in the plane. This property provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of irreducible unitary representations of the group E2 or of its covering groups. A crucial point is that, due to the fact that the subgroup SO2 Ð¥ S1 is multiply connected, these representations allow for fractional OAM l = á n + â¦ , n à· Z , â¦ à· 0 , 1. Such â¦ 0 have already been observed in cases like the Aharonov-Bohm and fractional quantum Hall effects, and they correspond to the quasimomenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals. The proposal of the present paper is to look for fractional OAM in connection with the quantum optics of LaguerreGaussian laser modes in external magnetic fields. The quantum theory of the phase space Sâ¸,pâ¸ in terms of unitary representations of E2 allows for two types of âcoherentâ states, the properties of which are discussed in detail: nonholomorphic minimal-uncertainty states and holomorphic ones associated with Bargmann-Segal Hilbert spaces.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of quantizing properly the canonical pair “angle and action variables”, ϕ and I, is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself and since decades an intensively debated but still unresolved issue in quantum optics. The present paper proposes a new approach to the problem, namely quantization in terms of the group SO(1,2): The crucial point is that the phase space equation image has the global structure equation image (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized in the conventional manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts transitively, effectively and Hamilton-like on that space its irreducible unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide the appropriate quantum theoretical framework. The phase space equation image has the conic structure of an orbifold equation image. That structure is closely related to a Z2 gauge symmetry which corresponds to the center of a 2-fold covering of SO(1,2), the symplectic group equation image. The basic variables on the phase space are the functions h0 = I , h1 = I cos ϕ and h2 = -I sin ϕ the Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie algebra equation image. In the quantum theory they are represented by the self-adjoint Lie algebra generators K0, K1, and K2 of a unitary representation, where K0 has the spectrum {k + n, n = 0, 1, ...; k > 0}. A crucial prediction is that the classical Pythagorean relation h12 + h22 = h02 can be violated in the quantum theory. For each representation one can define three different types of coherent states the complex phases of which may be “measured” by means of the operators K1 and K2 alone without introducing any new phase operators! The SO(1,2) structure of optical squeezing and interference properties as well as that of the harmonic oscillator are analyzed in detail. The additional coherent states can be used for the introduction of (Husimi type) “Q” distributions and (Sudarshan-Glauber type) “P” representations of the density operator. The three operators K0, K1, and K2 are fundamental in the sense that one can construct composite position and momentum operators out of them! The new framework poses quite a number of fascinating experimental and theoretical challenges.},

When all atoms are initially in the leg with higher energy, we find a drastic reduction of the interchain particle transfer for slow linear sweeps, in quantitative agreement with recent experiments. This effect is preceded by a rapid broadening of the quasimomentum distribution of atoms, signaling the presence of a bath of low-energy excitations in the chains. We further investigate the scenario of quantum quenches to fixed values of the energy bias. We find that for a large enough density the momentum distribution relaxes to that of an equilibrium thermal state with the same energy.},

  Abstract                 = {Perfect transfer of a quantum state through a one-dimensional chain is now well understood, allowing one not only to decide whether a fixed Hamiltonian achieves perfect transfer but to design a suitable one. We are particularly interested in being able to design, or understand the limitations imposed upon, Hamiltonians subject to various naturally arising constraints such as a limited coupling topology with low connectivity (specified by a graph) and type of interaction. In this paper, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for transfer through a network and describe some natural consequences such as the impossibility of routing between many different recipients for a large class of Hamiltonians and the limitations on transfer rate. We also consider some of the trade-offs that arise in uniformly coupled networks (both Heisenberg and XX models) between transfer distance and the size of the network as a consequence of the derived conditions.},

To this end, the light propagation in a Glauber-Fock waveguide lattice serves as equivalent for the displacement of Fock states in phase space. Theoretical calculations and analogue classical experiments show that the square-root distribution of the coupling parameter in such lattices supports a new family of intriguing quantum correlations not encountered in uniform arrays. Because of the broken shift invariance of the lattice, these correlations strongly depend on the transverse position. Consequently, quantum random walks with this extra degree of freedom may be realized in Glauber-Fock lattices.},

This makes it possible to distinguish pairs of photons born at sufficiently different depths inside the crystal with a consequent decrease in two-photon interference. We study this effect in detail for degenerate collinear type-II SPDC and degenerate type-I SPDC.

Constructing a suitable quantum version of a random walk is not trivial; pure quantum dynamics is deterministic, so randomness only enters during the measurement phase, i.e. when converting the quantum information into classical information. The outcome of a quantum random walk is very different from the corresponding classical random walk owing to the interference between the different possible paths. The upshot is that quantum walkers find themselves further from their starting point than a classical walker on average, and this forms the basis of a quantum speed up, which can be exploited to solve problems faster. Surprisingly, the effect of making the walk slightly less than perfectly quantum can optimize the properties of the quantum walk for algorithmic applications. Looking to the future, even with a small quantum computer available, the development of quantum walk algorithms might proceed more rapidly than it has, especially for solving real problems.},

The systems studied consist of a quantum-mechanical quasiparticle such as an electron or an excitation, interacting strongly with classical vibrations of the lattice, the entire assembly being in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. The technique used for the study of thermal stability consists of the diagonalization of an N XN matrix where N is the number of sites among which the quasiparticle moves, followed by M thermal integrations where M is the number of vibrational coordinates with which the quasiparticle interacts. A basic duality emerges regarding the effect of temperature on the stability of nonlinear structures: temperature is found to help the nonlinearity in certain parameter and temperature regimes by inducing disorder and to destroy the nonlinearity in other regimes, e.g., always at large temperatures as a consequence of Boltzmann equalization. Particularly interesting features are found at low temperatures. A magnetic analogy reported earlier for smaller systems is reinforced by the present analysis for extended systems.},

We demonstrate its experimental feasibility in future gravitational-wave detectors and tabletop optomechanical devices. This work not only outlines a feasible way to investigate nonclassicality in macroscopic optomechanical systems, but also presents a new and elegant approach for solving non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in general linear systems.},

Our experiments are carried out using a minimal pen, a long narrow tube that serves as a reservoir of liquid, which can write on a model of paper, a hydrophilic micropillar array. A minimal theory for the rate of wicking or spreading of the liquid is given by balancing the capillary force that drives the liquid flow and the resistance associated with flow through the porous substrate. This allows us to predict the shape of the front and the width of the line laid out by the pen, with results that are corroborated by our experiments.},

This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social1 and neural2 networks to protein folding3 and magnetism4,5. Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exoticmaterials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses6â9. Here we realize a quantumsimulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions10â12, whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces13. We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.},

Classical and quantum sources are shown to yield significantly different results; Schr{\"o}dinger-cat states can enhance the signal by an order of magnitude. Moreover, squeezing of the source can help to individually control and characterize excitons, biexcitons and electronâhole complexes.},

In the special case of fixed impurities with two internal states the atoms represent a quantum register and the QME reproduces the exact evolution of the qubits. We characterize the qubit dephasing which is caused by the interspecies coupling and show that the effect of sub- and super-decoherence is observable for realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, the BEC phonons mediate an attractive interaction between the impurities, which has an important impact on their spatial distribution. If the lattice atoms are allowed to move, there occurs a sharp transition with the impurities aggregating in a macroscopic cluster at experimentally achievable temperatures. We also investigate the impact of the BEC on the transport properties of the impurity atoms and show that a crossover from coherent to diffusive behaviour occurs with increasing interaction strength.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a general method for diagonalizing a wide class of nonlinear Hamiltonians describing different quantum optical models. This method makes use of a nonlinear deformation of the usual su 2 algebra and when some physical parameter, dictated by the particular model under consideration, becomes small, it gives a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that describes correctly the dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We apply as well the technique to three-level systems interacting with quantum fields, showing that it is possible to engineer resonant interactions through nonresonant processes.},

Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scatterin probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves clogT as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined wth the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the s-d exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum. The temperature at wich the minimum occurs is proportional to c^1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted logT dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 eV, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface},

However, when a matter qubit is homogeneously broadened, the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED is typically required, which is hard to realize in actual experimental setups. Here, we show that a high-fidelity entanglement operation is possible even in the weak-coupling regime in which dampings (dephasing, spontaneous emission, and cavity leakage) overwhelm the coherent coupling between a qubit and the cavity. Our proposal enables distributed quantum information processing to be performed using much less demanding technology than previously.},

This single-impurity problem is defined by the U5` Anderson model with an additional densitydensity interaction, as well as an explicit exchange interaction, between the impurity and conduction electrons. We find three points in the interaction parameter space at which all the correlation functions can be calculated explicitly. These points represent the mixed-valence counterparts of the usual Toulouse point for the Kondo problem, and are appropriately named the Toulouse points of the mixed-valence problem. Two of these Toulouse points exhibit a strong coupling, Fermi liquid behavior. The third one shows spin-charge separation; here, the spin-spin correlation functions are Fermi-liquid-like, the charge-charge correlation functions and the single-particle Green function have non-Fermi-liquid behaviors, and a pairing correlation function is enhanced compared to the Fermi liquid case. This third Toulouse point describes the intermediate mixed-valence phase we have previously identified. In deriving these results, we emphasize the importance of keeping track of the anticommutation relation between the fermion fields when applying the bosonization method to the mixedvalence problem.},

The aBG beams are described by the product of a Gaussian function by the nth-order Bessel function of the first kind of complex argument, having finite energy. The aBG beam’s asymmetry degree depends on a real parameter c ≥ 0: at c  0, the aBG beam is coincident with a conventional radially symmetric Bessel–Gauss (BG) beam; with increasing c, the aBG beam acquires a semicrescent shape, then becoming elongated along the y axis and shifting along the x axis for c ≫ 1. In the initial plane, the intensity distribution of the aBG beams has a countable number of isolated optical nulls on the x axis, which result in optical vortices with unit topological charge and opposite signs on the different sides of the origin. As the aBG beam propagates, the vortex centers undergo a nonuniform rotation with the entire beam about the optical axis (c ≫ 1), making a π∕4 turn at the Rayleigh range and another π∕4 turn after traveling the remaining distance. At different values of the c parameter, the optical nulls of the transverse intensity distribution change their position, thus changing the OAM that the beam carries. An isolated optical null on the optical axis generates an optical vortex with topological charge n. A vortex laser beam shaped as a rotating semicrescent has been generated using a spatial light modulator.},

The asymmetry degree of the nonparaxial aB-mode is shown to depend on a real parameter c≥0: when c=0, the aB-mode is identical to a conventional radially symmetric Bessel mode; with increasing c, the aB-mode starts to acquire a crescent form, getting stretched along the vertical axis and shifted along the horizontal axis for c≫1. On the horizontal axis, the aB-modes have a denumerable number of isolated intensity zeros that generate optical vortices with a unit topological charge of opposite sign on opposite sides of 0. At different values of the parameter c, the intensity zeros change their location on the horizontal axis, thus changing the beam’s OAM. An isolated intensity zero on the optical axis generates an optical vortex with topological charge n. The OAM per photon of an aB-mode depends near-linearly on c, being equal to ℏ(n+cI1(2c)/I0(2c)), where ℏ is the Planck constant and In(x) is a modified Bessel function.},

We, for the first time, show how to generate a 2-D light field with its power flux circulating about a ring. Also, we consider accelerating nonparaxial asymmetric 2-D Bessel beams, which are obtained from a conventional 2-D Bessel beam by shifting its center to the complex plane. We show numerically that with increasing asymmetry parameter of the Bessel beam, its curved path becomes shorter, whereas the side-lobes are suppressed with respect to the central peak.},

As a result of this instability, the role of the ground state is played by a periodic process generating superradiance (in contrast to laser radiation induced by overpopulation of the upper level). A classical analogue of a super-radiant quantum transition, a system of van der Pol-Duffing oscillators (generators) weakly coupled via a linear oscillator, is for the first time described. Such an analogue is a strongly modulated oscillatory process of almost complete periodic energy exchange between the generators. It is shown that a necessary condition for the transition to intense energy exchange in the classical system is the instability of one of the nonlinear normal modes, similar to how the condition for a superradiant transition to occur is the instability of the ground state of a two-level quantum system coupled with a resonant electromagnetic field.},

A method is developed which yields the partition function as the largest eigenvalue of some finite matrix, as long as the manifold is only one dimensionally infinite. The method is carried out fully for the linear chain of spins which has no ferromagnetic properties. Then a sequence of finite matrices is found whose largest eigenvalue approaches the partition function of the two-dimensional square net as the matrix order gets large. It is shown that these matrices possess a symmetry property which permits location of the Curie temperature if it exists and is unique. It lies at J/kTc=0.8814 if we denote by J the coupling energy between neighboring spins. The symmetry relation also excludes certain forms of singularities at Tc, as, e.g., a jump in the specific heat.

  Abstract                 = {The study of the two-dimensional Ising model is continued. Its specific heat at the Curie point is investigated. The quantity in question is computed for six successive finite matrix problems and the conclusion is drawn that the specific heat is infinite at the Curie point. A new closed form approximation of the partition function $\lambda$ is then developed by using the matrix method in its variational form. The two power series for $\lambda$ at extreme temperatures are used as a test for this and various other approximations, and it is found that the new result is a considerable improvement over the existing solutions. Finally it is pointed out that these closed form solutions support our conclusion as to the place and nature of the Curie point transition.},

  Abstract                 = {By considering AdS5 Ã S 5 string states with large S 5 angular momenta one can provide non-trivial quantitative checks of the AdS/CFT duality. A string rotating in S 5 with two angular momenta J1 , J2 is dual to an operator in N = 4 SYM theory whose conformal dimension can be computed by diagonalizing a (generalization of) spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain Hamiltonian. It was recently argued and verified to lowest order in a large J = J1 + J2 expansion, that the Heisenberg chain can be described using a non-relativistic low energy effective 2d action for a unit vector field ni which exactly matches the corresponding large J limit of the classical AdS5 Ã S 5 string action. In this paper we show that this agreement extends to the next order and develop a systematic procedure for computing higher orders in such large angular momentum expansion. This involves several nontrivial steps. On the string side, we need to choose a special gauge with a non-diagonal world-sheet metric which insures that the angular momentum is uniformly distributed along the string, as indeed is the case on the spin chain side. We need also to implement an order by order redefinition of the field ni to get an action linear in the time derivative. On the spin chain side, it turns out to be crucial to include the effects of integrating out short wave-length modes. In this way we gain a better understanding of how (a subsector of) the string sigma model emerges from the dual gauge theory, allowing us to demonstrate the duality beyond comparing particular examples of states with large J .},

We calculate the differential rate and concurrence for a backscattering setup of the electron and photon beam, employing Volkov states and propagators for the electron lines, thus accounting nonperturbatively for the electron-laser interaction.

This approach is beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA) and more importantly, remains the RWA form with a renormalized tunneling strength and a modified driving strength. The reformulated rotating-wave method not only possesses the same mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA but also allows us to explore the effects of counter-rotating (CR) components. We focus on the properties of off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks down. After comparing the results of different RWA schemes and those of the numerically exact method in a wide range of parameter regime, we show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics which is in good agreement with the numerical method. Moreover, the other RWA methods appear as various limiting cases of the CHRW method. The CHRW method reveals the effects of the CR terms clearly by means of coherent destruction of tunneling and Bloch-Siegert shift. Our main results are as follows: (i) the dynamics of the coherent destruction of tunneling is explicitly given and its dependence on Δ is clarified, which is quantitatively in good agreement with the exact results; (ii) the CR modulated Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift are analytically calculated, which is the same as the exact results up to fourth order; (iii) the validity of parameter regions of different RWA methods are given and the comparison of dynamics of these methods are shown. Since the CHRW approach is mathematically simple as well as tractable and physically clear, it may be extended to some complicated problems where it is difficult to do a numerical study.},

Here we analyze and time-adjust the photon-counting statistics of such a single-photon source and show that the photon statistics can be described by a simple transport-like nonequilibrium model. We then show that there is a one-to-one correspondence of this model to that of nonequilibrium transport of electrons through a double quantum dot nanostructure, unifying the fields of photon-counting statistics and electron-transport statistics.

It has been especially argued that a nontrivial geometric phase is achievable even in the situation of no cavity photons. We, however, show that such results hinge on imposing the rotating wave approximation (RWA), while without the RWA no Berry phases occur in these schemes. A geometrical interpretation of our results is obtained by introducing semiclassical energy surfaces which in a simple way brings out the phase-space dynamics. With the RWA, a conical intersection between the surfaces emerges and encircling it gives rise to the Berry phase. Without the RWA, the conical intersection is absent and therefore the Berry phase vanishes. It is believed that this is a first example showing how the application of the RWA in the Jaynes-Cummings model may lead to false conclusions, regardless of the mutual strengths between the system parameters.},

The characteristic long-range order of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is here mediated by the cavity field. For a closed qubit system, the inherent second-order phase transition of the qubits is reflected in the intensity of the output cavity field. In the broken symmetry phase, the many-body ground state is highly entangled. Relaxation of the qubits is analyzed within a mean-field treatment.

The physically interesting cases of Gaussian and standing wave shapes of the cavity mode are considered. An analytical approximate measure for adiabaticity is given and compared with numerical wave packet simulations. Good agreement is obtained where the approximations are expected to be valid. Usually for cavity QED systems, the large atom-field detuning case is considered as the adiabatic limit. We, however, show that adiabaticity is also valid, for the Gaussian mode shape, in the opposite limit. Effective semiclassical timedependent models, which do not take into account the shape of the wave packet, are derived. Corrections to such an effective theory, which are purely quantum mechanical, are discussed. It is shown that many of the results presented can be applied to time-dependent two-level systems.},

Here we report optical measurements on a single semiconductor quantum dot tunnelcoupled to a degenerate electron gas which show that absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in the system Hamiltonian and a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. By inferring the characteristic power-law exponents from the experimental absorption line shapes, we find a unique signature of the quench in the form of an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe6,7, induced by a vanishing overlap between the initial and final manybody wavefunctions. We show that the power-law exponent that determines the degree of orthogonality can be tuned using an external magnetic field8, which unequivocally demonstrates that the observed absorption line shape originates from Kondo correlations. Our experiments demonstrate that optical measurements on single artificial atoms offer new perspectives on many-body phenomena previously studied using transport spectroscopy only.},

  Abstract                 = {A few simply stated rules govern the entanglement patterns that can occur in mutually unbiased basis sets (MUBs) and constrain the combinations of such patterns that can coexist in full complements of MUBs. We consider Hilbert spaces of prime power dimensions (D = pN), as realized by systems of N prime-state particles, where full complements of D + 1 MUBs are known to exist, and we assume only that MUBs are eigenbases of generalized Pauli operators, without using any particular construction. The general rules include the following: (1) In any MUB, a given particle appears either in a pure state or totally entangled and (2) in any full MUB complement, each particle is pure in (p + 1) bases (not necessarily the same ones) and totally entangled in the remaining (pN - p). It follows that the maximum number of product bases is p + 1 and, when this number is realized, all remaining (pN - p) bases in the complement are characterized by the total entanglement of every particle. This âstandard distributionâ is inescapable for two-particle systems (of any p), where only product and generalized Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the following results generalize previous results for qubits [Phys. Rev. A 65. 032320 (2002); Phys. Rev. A 72, 062310 (2005)] and qutrits [Phys. Rev. A 70, 012302 (2004)], drawing particularly upon [Phys. Rev. A 72, 062310 (2005).]. With three particles there are three MUB types, and these may be combined in (p + 2) different ways to form full complements. With N = 4, there are 6 MUB types for p = 2, but new MUB types become possible with larger p, and these are essential to realizing full complements.With this example, we argue that newMUB types that show new entanglement patterns should enter with every step in N and, also, when N is a prime plus 1, at a critical p value, p = N - 1. Such MUBs should play critical roles in filling complements.},

We demonstrate strong Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen correlations between the angular position and orbital angular momentum of two photons created by the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The discrete nature of orbital angular momentum and the continuous but periodic nature of angular position give rise to a special sort of entanglement between these two variables. The resulting correlations are found to be an order of magnitude stronger than those allowed by the uncertainty principle for independent (nonentangled) particles. Our results suggest that angular position and orbital angular momentum may find important applications in quantum information science.},

This leads to the prediction of several rotational effects: the spatial or time evolution of either particleâs spin-polarization vector is controlled by its OAM quantum number or, conversely, its spatial wave function is controlled by its SAM. We show that the common origin of these effects in electrons and photons is a universal geometric phase.

We emphasize that the resonant tunneling and interaction may allow creating single-atom devices with promising technology applications.

For experimental relevance, we evaluate the participation ratio and the intensity correlation function as measures of localization for two types of disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal), for two types of interaction (repulsive and attractive), and for a variety of initial input states. Employing a commonly used set of initial states, we show that the effect of interaction on Anderson localization is strongly dependent on the type of disorder and initial conditions, but is independent of whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive. We then analyze a certain type of entangled input state where the type of interaction is relevant and discuss how it can be naturally implemented in waveguide arrays.

By employing a linearized quantum theory we find that quantumnoise squeezing of gap solitons, produced during their evolution, is enhanced compared with the atomic solitons in a lattice-free case due to intrasoliton structure of quantum correlations induced by the Bragg scattering in the periodic potential. We also show that nonlinear interaction of gap solitons in dynamically stable bound states can produce strong atom-number correlation between the soliton pairs.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at the interface between a stationary isotropic medium and a uniaxially anisotropic medium moving parallel to the interface is investigated. Solutions are obtained for both incident E-wave and H-wave when the moving medium is either a nondispersive uniaxial crystal or a dispersive uniaxial plasma. It is found that (i) total reflection is possible even if the wave is incident from a comparatively less "dense" medium into a "dense" medium; (ii) Brewster angles may exist even for incident E-wave; (iii) backward wave may be excited in the moving uniaxial plasma by an incident H-wave. Other interesting features which are not found in the case of two stationary media are also discussed in detail, and a few numerical examples are given.},

It is shown that the familiar “macroscopic quantum phenomena” such as flux quantization and the Josephson effect are irrelevant in this context, because they correspond to states having a very small value of a certain critical property (christened “disconnectivity”) while the states important for a discussion of the quantum theory of measurement have a very high value of this property. Various possibilities for verifying experimentally the existence of such states are discussed, with the conclusion that the most promising is probably the observation of quantum tunnelling between states with macroscopically different properties. It is shown that because of their very high “quantum purity” and consequent very low dissipation at low temperatures, superconducting systems (in particular SQUID rings) offer good prospects for such an observation.},

It is primarily and extended account of results obtained over the las four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contests include (1) an exact and general prescripction for the reduction, under the appropiate circumstances, of the proble of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the ``spin-boson'' problem; (2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem; (3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the error incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space these errors are either very small in the limit of interest to us (the ``slow-tunneling'' limit) or can themselves be evaluated with satisfactory accuracy; (4) use of these results to obtain qunatitative expressions for the dynamics of the system as function of the spectral density J(w) of its coupling to the environment. If J(w) begaves as w^s for frequencies of the order of the tunneling frequency or smaller, the authors find for the ``unbiased'' case the following results: For s<1 the system is localized at zero temperature, and at finite T relaxes incoherently at a rate proportional to ex-(T0/T)^(1-s). For s>2 it undergoes underdamped coherent oscillations for all relevant temperatures, while for 1<s<2 there is a crossover from coherent oscillation to overdamped relaxation as T increases. Exact expressions for the oscillations and/or relaxation rates are presented in all these cases. For the ``ohmic'' case, s=1, the qualitative nature of the behavior depends critically on the dimensionless coupling strength a as well as the temperature T: over most of the (a, T) plane (including the whole region a>1) the behavior is an incoherent relaxation at a rate proportional to T^(2a -1), but for low T and 0<a<1/2 the authors predict a combination of damped coherent oscillation and incoherent background which appears to disagree with the results of all previous approximations. The case of finite bias is also discussed.},

We engineer this coupling by applying six continuous-wave microwave drives with appropriate frequencies. The two qubits need not be identical. We show that our approach does not require any ﬁne-tuning of the parameters and requires only that certain ratios between them be large. With currently achievable coherence times, simulations indicate that a Bell state can be maintained over arbitrary long times with ﬁdelities above 94%. Such performance leads to a signiﬁcant violation of Bell’s inequality (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt correlation larger than 2.6) for arbitrary long times.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a comprehensive study of the thermodynamic properties of the three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model, with application to cold fermionic atoms subject to an optical lattice and a trapping potential. Our study is focused on the temperature range of current experimental interest. We employ two theoretical methods- dynamical mean-field theory and high-temperature series-and perform comparative benchmarks to delimit their respective range of validity. Special attention is devoted to understand the implications that thermodynamic properties of this system have on cooling. Considering the distribution function of local occupancies in the inhomogeneous lattice, we show that, under adiabatic evolution, the variation of any observable (e.g., temperature) can be conveniently disentangled into two distinct contributions. The first contribution is due to the redistribution of atoms in the trap during the evolution, while the second one comes from the intrinsic change of the observable. Finally, we provide a simplified picture of a recently proposed cooling procedure, based on spatial entropy separation, by applying this method to an idealized model.},

We analyse the energy level structure throughout a wide range of field gradients. An investigation of the electronic spin properties is performed by studying the spatially dependent spin-polarization which exhibits a rich nodal structure. We compute wavelengths and strengths for electromagnetic transitions and provide the selection rules. A discussion of the so-called ellipsoidal states which exhibit unique properties such as large mean orbital angular momenta and spatial compactness is provided. The property of magnetic field-induced permanent electric dipole moments is analysed in detail.

The variation in the Doppler contour by the trapping effect is investigated. It is illustrated, in particular, that the width of the narrow peak at the line centre depends mainly on the finite transit time of the atoms through the light beam. Next it is shown that, by accumulating slow atoms in a three-dimensional standing wave, it is possible, in principle, to observe narrow peaks with their widths determined only by the natural line width.

The model is related to a class of composite and artificial optical media that have recently attracted much interest. The analysis is focused on moving solitons, as this is relevant to the experiment. By means of systematic simulations, we find that, in accordance with a qualitative consideration, the stability region for moving solitons first increases with velocity c but then decreases (in contrast to the uniform fiber BG, where the stability of the solitons depends very weakly on c). As well as in the uniform system, solitons do not exist for c exceeding the group velocity of light in the fiber, nor may they be stable with negative intrinsic frequencies. Collisions between solitons moving in opposite directions are also studied in a systematic way. A difference from the situation in the uniform fiber BG is strong shrinkage and eventual disappearance of a region where the collision results in a merger of the two solitons into a single one, which is explained too. Fiber waveguides with BG superstructures being currently available, moving solitons can be created in them by means of experimental techniques similar to those that have helped to generate solitons in uniform fiber gratings.},

Each particular solution of the equation for ρ determines an invariant. The invariants are derived by applying an asymptotic theory due to Kruskal to the oscillator system in closed form. As a consequence, the results are more general than the asymptotic treatment, and are even applicable with complex Ω(t) and quantum systems. A generating function is given for a classical canonical transformation to a class of new canonical variables which are so chosen that the new momentum is any particular member of the class of invariants. The new coordinate is, of course, a cyclic variable. The meaning of the invariants is discussed, and the general solution for ρ(t) is given in terms of linearly independent solutions of the equations of motion for the classical oscillator. The general solution for ρ(t) is evaluated for some special cases. Finally, some aspects of the application of the invariants to quantum systems are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory of explicitly time-dependent invariants is developed for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians are explicitly time dependent. The central feature of the discussion is the derivation of a simple relation between eigensatates of such an invariant and solutions of the Schrodinger equation. As a specific well-posed application of the general theory, the case of a general Hamiltonian which settles into constant operators in the sufficientle remote past and future is treated and, in particular, the transition amplitude connecting any initial state in the remote past to any final state in the remote future is calculated in terms of eigenstates of the invariant. Two special physical systems are treated in detail: an arbitrarily time-dependent harmonico oscillator and a charged particle movin in the classical, axially symmetric electromagnetic field consisting of an arbitrarily time-dependent, uniform magnetic field, the associated induced electric field, and the electric field due to an arbitrarily time-dependent uniform charge distribution. A class of explicitlytime-dependent invariants is derived for both of these systems and the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the invariants are calculated explicitly by operator methods. The explicit connection between these eigenstates and solutions of the Schrodingr equation is also calclated. The results fro the oscillator are used to obtain explicit formals for the transition amplitude. The usual sudden and adiabatic approximations are deduced as limiting cases of the exact formulas.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the opposite occurs in discrete media: hidden vortex states in relatively small ring chains become unstable with the increase of the total power, while explicit vortices are stable, provided that the corresponding scalar vortex state is also stable. There are also stable mixed states, in which the components are vortices with different topological charges. Additionally, degeneracies in families of composite vortex modes lead to the existence of long-lived breather states which can exhibit vortex-charge flipping in one or both components.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that the momentum density of free electromagnetic field splits into two parts. One has no contribution to the net momentum due to the transversality condition. The other yields all the momentum. The angular momentum that originates from the former part is spin, and the angular momentum that originates from the latter part is orbital angular momentum. Expressions for the spin and orbital angular momentum are given in terms of the electric vector in reciprocal space. The spin and orbital angular momentum defined this way are used to investigate the angular momentum of nonparaxial beams that are described in a recently published paper Phys. Rev. A 78, 063831 2008. It is found that the orbital angular momentum depends, apart from an l-dependent term, on two global quantities, the polarization represented by a generalized Jones vector and another characteristic represented by a unit vector I, though the spin depends only on the polarization. The polarization dependence of orbital angular momentum through the effect of I is obtained and discussed. Some applications of the result obtained here are also made. The fact that the spin originates from the part of momentum density that has no contribution to the net momentum is used to show that there does not exist the paradox on the spin of circularly polarized plane wave. The polarization dependence of both spin and orbital angular momentum is shown to be the origin of conversion from the spin of a paraxial Laguerre-Gaussian beam into the orbital angular momentum of the focused beam through a high numerical aperture.},

The persistent rotation of trapped ions produces the temporal order, leading to the formation of a space-time crystal. We show that these spacetime crystals are robust for direct experimental observation. We also study the effects of finite temperatures on the persistent rotation.

Recently, this limit has been overcome in optics as the growing up of the self-accelerating Airy beams, which are featured by many peculiar properties, e.g., bending propagation, diffraction-free and self-healing. However, the bending angles of Airy beams are rather small since they are only paraxial solutions of the two-dimensional (2D) Helmholtz equation. Here we propose a novel micromanipulation by using acoustic Half-Bessel beams, which are strict solutions of the 2D Helmholtz equation. Compared with that achieved by Airy beams, the bending angle of the particle trajectory attained here is much steeper (exceeding 90o). The large-angle bending transport of microparticles, which is robust to complex scattering environment, enables a wide range of applications from the colloidal to biological sciences.},

  Abstract                 = {We theoretically study how to control transport, bound states, and resonant states of a single photon in a one-dimensional coupled-cavity array. We find that the transport of a single photon in the cavity array can be controlled by tuning the frequency of either one or two cavities. If one of the cavities in the array has a tunable frequency, and its frequency is tuned to be larger (or smaller) than those of other cavities, then there is a photon bound state above (or below) the energy band of the coupled-cavity array. However, if two cavities in the array have tunable frequencies, then there exist both bound states and resonant states. If the frequencies of the two cavities are chosen to be much larger than those of other cavities, and the hopping couplings between any two nearest-neighbor cavities are weak, then a single photon with a resonant wave vector can be trapped in the region between the two frequency-tunable cavities. In this case, a quantum supercavity can be formed by these two frequency-tunable cavities. We also study how to apply this photon transport control to an array of coupled superconducting transmission line resonators.},

When the single-photon optomechanical-coupling strength is moderately larger than the mechanical frequency, then our method works well for a wide range of cavity-field decay rates, irrespective of whether or not the system is in the resolved-sideband regime.},

We develop a perturbative expansion of partition function and a simple analytic expression is found for a high coupling constant. We show that, in this limit, the interaction of independent atomic spins with a single photon mode can be interpreted as an effective spin-spin interaction of long range nature.

Next the Pauli principle, together with some facts about Thomas-Fermi theory, is shown, to account for the stability (i.e. saturation) of bulk matter. Thomas-Fermi theory is developed in some detail because, as is also pointed out, it is the asymptotically correct picture of heavy atoms and molecules.

The micro-lever is a second class lever comprising an optical trapping sphere, a beam, and a pivot. A micro-spring is placed between the short and long arms to characterize the induced force. This design enables precise manipulation of the micro-lever by optical tweezers at the micron scale. Under optical dragging, the sphere placed on the lever beam moves, resulting in torque that induces related force on the spring. The optical force applied at the sphere is approximately 100 to 300 pN, with a laser power of 100 to 300 mW. In this study, the optical tweezers drives the micro-lever successfully. The relationship between the optical force and the spring constant can be determined by using the principle of leverage. The arm ratio design developed in this study multiplies the applied optical force by 9. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation of spring property.},

New families of solitons, vortices, and soliton rings with elliptical symmetry are found and investigated. With a suitable symmetry-breaking parameter, we show that perturbed elliptical solitons tend to move transversely owing to the existences of dipole excitation modes, which are totally suppressed in circularly symmetric solitons. Furthermore, by numerical evolutions we demonstrate that elliptical vortices and soliton rings collapse into a pair of stripes and clusters, respectively, revealing the experimental observations in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing first-order Green's-function theories of the Heisenberg ferromagnet all lead to magnon energies for which the temperature renormalization is wave vector independent. Such theories can describe phase transitions only at a temperature TC for which all spin-wave excitations have vanishingly small energy. It has become increasingly evident, particularly for systems of low dimensionality, that such an approximation is quite unphysical, paramagnetic magnons often being physically well defined over much of the Brillouin zone to quite elevated temperatures. This paper describes a rather general method for introducing wave-vector-dependent magnon renormalization into the Green's-function formalism, enabling approximations of obvious physical significance to be made directly in terms of the magnon dispersion relation. The theory is developed in detail for the simplest nontrivial approximation and applied to the problem of the two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet. A phase transition is found to a state of zero magnetization and infinite susceptibility. We also discuss the weakly anisotropic two-dimensional ferromagnet, which supports long-range order at low temperatures, and study the approach to the isotropic limit.},

The construction of such models is based on the observation that bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators can be considered as generators of Lie groups. Thus the problem of finding eigenvalues can be greatly simplified by the additional integrals of the motion which are present if the Hamiltonian is constructed so as to commute with invariants of the group. In the present case, the model consists of N fermions distributed in two N-fold degenerate levels and interacting via a monopole-monopole force. It is shown that the model Hamiltonian is easily expressed in terms of quasi-spin operators and exact eigenvalues are obtained. In addition, eigenvalues are calculated with ordinary perturbation theory using values for the number of particles and interaction strength which are appropriate to the more realistic problems of finite nuclei. In subsequent papers we consider the results obtained by various other approximation methods for comparison with the exact results presented here.},

By considering the two qubits that are initially prepared in the Werner state, we study the evolution of the quantum discord and that of entanglement under the same conditions. Our results imply that entanglement can disappear completely after a finite time, while the quantum discord decreases and tends to be a stable value according to the initial-state parameter for a very-long-time interval. In this sense, the quantum discord is more robust than entanglement for the quantum system exposed to the environment. The relation between the quantum correlations and the classical correlation is also shown for two particular cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the numerically exact solution to the Dicke model proposed previously, we study the quantum criticality in terms of the ground-state (GS) energy, fidelity, and the order parameter. The finite size scaling analysis for the average fidelity susceptibility (FS) and second derivative of GS energy are performed. The correlation length exponent is obtained to be ν=2/3, which is the same as that in Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model obtained previously, suggesting the same universality. It is observed that average FS and second derivative of GS energy show similar critical behavior, demonstrating the intrinsic relation in the Dicke model. The scaling behavior for the order parameter and the singular part of the GS energy at the critical point are also analyzed and the obtained exponents are consistent with the previous scaling hypothesis in 1/N expansion scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {The observation of quantized nanomechanical oscillations by detecting femtometer-scale displacements is a significant challenge for experimentalists. We propose that a phonon blockade can serve as a signature of quantum behavior in nanomechanical resonators. In analogy to the photon blockade and Coulomb blockade for electrons, the main idea for phonon blockade is that the second phonon cannot be excited when there is one phonon in the nonlinear oscillator. To realize phonon blockade, a superconducting quantum two-level system is coupled to the nanomechanical resonator and is used to induce the phonon self-interaction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of the induced nonlinear oscillator is studied via the Cahill-Glauber s-parametrized quasiprobability distributions. We show how the oscillation of the resonator can occur in the quantum regime and demonstrate how the phonon blockade can be observed with the currently accessible experimental parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a coupling decoupling method between a superconducting qubit and a data bus that uses a controllable time-dependent electromagnetic field TDEF. As in recent experiments, the data bus can be either an LC circuit or a cavity field. When the qubit and the data bus are initially fabricated, their detuning should be made far larger than their coupling constant, so these can be treated as two independent subsystems. However, if a TDEF is applied to the qubit, then a âdressed qubitâ i.e., qubit plus the electromagnetic field can be formed. By choosing appropriate parameters for the TDEF, the dressed qubit can be coupled to the data bus and, thus, the qubit and the data bus can exchange information with the assistance of the TDEF. This mechanism allows the scalability of the circuit to many qubits. With the help of the TDEF, any two qubits can be selectively coupled to and decoupled from a common data bus. Therefore, quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of parity-time (PT) symmetry in the field of optics has been intensively explored. This study shows the absence of exceptional points in a three-dimensional system composed of a square waveguide array with diagonally-balanced gain/loss distribution. More specifically, we show that an array of four coupled waveguides supports eight fundamental propagation supermodes, four of which are singlet, and the other two pairs are double degenerated. It is found that the singlet states follow the routine PT phase transition; however, the double-degenerated modes never coalesce as the gain/ loss-to-coupling strength level varies, showing no actual PT symmetry-derived behavior. This is evident in the phase rigidity which does not approach zero. The absence of exceptional points is ascribed to the coupling of non-symmetric supermodes formed in the diagonal waveguide pairs. Our results suggest comprehensive interplay between the mode pattern symmetry, the lattice symmetry, and the PTsymmetry, which should be carefully considered in PT-phenomena design in waveguide arrays.},

Moreover, since both oscillators exhibit the SU(1,1) dynamical symmetry, the eigenvalue problem can be tackled in a uniﬁed manner. In the Hilbert space of analytic functions of a complex variable in the unit disc, the energy eigenvalue equations involve ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations only, so we can easily solve these equations to obtain simple closed-form solutions.},

These two types of BIC modes at the PT symmetry breaking point behave differently: in the former case, spatial localization is lost and the defect coherently radiates outgoing waves with an optical power that linearly increases with the propagation distance; in the latter case, localization is maintained and the optical power increase is quadratic.},

The equivalence between the ac-driven single-particle Krawtchouk Hamiltonian View the MathML source and the non-interacting ac-driven bosonic junction Hamiltonian enables to determine in a closed form the quasi energy spectrum of View the MathML source and the conditions for exact wave packet reconstruction (dynamic localization). In particular, we show that quantum recurrence, which is predicted by the general quantum recurrence theorem, is exact for the Krawtchouk quantum chain in a dense range of the driving amplitude. Exact quantum recurrence provides perfect wave packet reconstruction at a frequency which is fractional than the driving frequency, a phenomenon that can be referred to as fractional dynamic localization.},

The optical medium that realizes CPA is obtained by reversing the gain with absorption, and thus it generally differs from the lasing medium. Here it is shown that a laser with an optical medium that satisfies the parity-time (PT ) symmetry condition (-r) = â (r) for the dielectric constant behaves simultaneously as a laser oscillator (i.e., it can emit outgoing coherent waves) and as a CPA (i.e., it can fully absorb incoming coherent waves with appropriate amplitudes and phases).

  Abstract                 = {Reflectionless defects in Hermitian tight-binding lattices, synthesized by the intertwining operator technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, are generally not invisible and time-of-flight measurements could reveal the existence of the defects. Here it is shown that, in a certain class of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices with complex hopping amplitudes, defects in the lattice can appear fully invisible to an outside observer. The synthesized non-Hermitian lattices with invisible defects possess a real-valued energy spectrum; however, they lack parity-time (PT ) symmetry, which does not play any role in the present work.},

Most of our knowledge of BIC is so far restricted to static potentials. Here we introduce a new kind of BIC, referred to as Floquet BIC, which corresponds to a normalizable Floquet state of a time-periodic Hamiltonian with a quasienergy embedded into the spectrum of Floquet scattered states. We discuss the appearance of Floquet BIC states in a tight-binding lattice model driven by an ac field in the proximity of the dynamic localization regime.},

The competition between coherent interaction and dissipation gives rise to a rich phase diagram characterizing the optical and mechanical many-body states. For weak intercellular coupling, the mechanical motion at different sites is incoherent due to the inﬂuence of quantum noise. When increasing the coupling strength, however, we observe a transition towards a regime of phase-coherent mechanical oscillations.

  Abstract                 = {In cavity optomechanics, nanomechanical motion couples to a localized optical mode. The regime of single-photon strong coupling is reached when the optical shift induced by a single phonon becomes comparable to the cavity linewidth. We consider a setup in this regime comprising two optical modes and one mechanical mode. For mechanical frequencies nearly resonant to the optical level splitting, we find the photon-phonon and the photon-photon interactions to be significantly enhanced. In addition to dispersive phonon detection in a novel regime, this offers the prospect of optomechanical photon measurement. We study these quantum nondemolition detection processes using both analytical and numerical approaches.},

Here we experimentally demonstrate the micro–macro entanglement of light. The macro system involves over a hundred million photons, whereas the micro system is at the single-photon level.We show that microscopic quantum fluctuations (in field quadrature measurements) on one side are correlated with macroscopic fluctuations (in the photon number statistics) on the other side. Further, we demonstrate entanglement by bringing the macroscopic state back to the single-photon level and performing full quantum state tomography of the final state. Although Schrödinger’s thought experiment was originally intended to convey the absurdity of applying quantum mechanics to macroscopic objects, this experiment and related ones suggest that it may apply on all scales.},

We show the completely destructive three photon interference for a large range of parameters of the three port device and point out the physical origin of such interference in terms of the contributions from different quantum paths. As each output port can deliver zero to three photons the device generates higher dimensional entanglement. In particular, different forms of entangled states of qudits can be generated depending on the device parameters.

Afterward, we explain pairwise correlations and entanglement in spin-squeezed states, as well as the relations between spin squeezing and quantum Fisher information, where the latter plays a central role in quantum metrology. We also review the applications of spin squeezing for detecting quantum chaos and quantum phase transitions, as well as the influence of decoherence on spin squeezing. Finally, we review several experimental realizations of spin squeezing, as well as their corresponding theoretical backgrounds, including: producing spin-squeezed states via particle collisions in Bose–Einstein condensates, transferring photon squeezing to atomic ensembles, and generating spin squeezing via quantum non-demolition measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Many proposals for solid-state photonic implementations of quantum information processing utilize highquality optical resonators to achieve strong coupling between guided fields and heterogeneously incorporated qubits. Given the practical difficulty of accurately placing quantum dots, vacancy centers, or other such atomlike emitters throughout a complex nanophotonic circuit, it would be natural to consider whether high-quality resonators could be used in conjunction with bulk optical nonlinearities to create optically coupled qubit degrees of freedom via lithographic patterning of a homogeneous medium. A recent limit theorem for quantum stochastic differential equations can be used to prove rigorously that this should be possible, in principle, using resonators incorporating a strongly Kerr-nonlinear, $\xi(2)$-nonlinear, or two-photon-absorbing material with very low loss at the fundamental optical wavelength.},

Experimental realizations of entanglement have hitherto been restricted to two-state quantum systems3±6, involving, for example, the two orthogonal polarization states of photons.Here we demonstrate entanglement involving the spatial modes of the electromagnetic ®eld carrying orbital angular momentum. As these modes can be used to de®ne an in®nitely dimensional discrete Hilbert space, this approach provides a practical route to entanglement that involves many orthogonal quantum states, rather than just two Multi-dimensional entangled states could be of considerable importance in the ®eld of quantum information7,8, enabling, for example, more efficient use of communication channels in quantum cryptography9},

These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily coupled with local interactions. Performing gate operations between an arbitrary pair of distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to couple the qubits to a âquantum busâ, which distributes quantum information among the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity-induced loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits. The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.},

In the second case of interest, I show that the angular distribution of the state function of a system initially prepared in a phased state appears to be chaotic; however, I show that this behavior is due to the high multiplicity of modes having close values for their amplification coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {The spin- 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques âanalytical (spinwave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renorrnalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical Neel ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the order disappears and the correlation length at low temperature T(k& T/J Â« 1, where J is the antiferromagnetic coupling) follows the singular form g( T)=C exp(a J/k& T). In the long-wavelength limit and at low T, the model has the same behavior as the quantum nonlinear o. model in two spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension, which we also study with available analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. The quasiparticles of the theory are bosons; at low T and for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length they are welldefined spin-wave excitations. The spectrum of such excitations and the temperature-dependent correlation length have been determined by neutron and Raman scattering experiments done on La2Cu04. The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility. We find that understanding the copper-oxide antiferromagnetic insulator is only the first essential step towards the development of a theory of the superconductor created upon doping such materials.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine several retro-reflecting optical elements, each involving two reflections. In the case of a hollow metallic cone having an apex angle of 90â¦, a circularly polarized incident beam acquires, upon reflection, the opposite spin angular momentum. However, no angular momentum is transferred to the cone, because the reflected beam picks up an orbital angular momentum that is twice as large but opposite in direction to that of its spin. A 90â¦ cone made of a transparent material in which the incident light suffers two total internal reflections before returning may be designed to endow the retro-reflected beam with different mixtures of orbital and spin angular momenta. Under no circumstances, however, is it possible to transfer angular momentum from the light beam to the cone without either allowing absorption or breaking the axial symmetry of the cone. A simple example of broken symmetry is provided by a wedge-shaped metallic reflector having an apex angle of 90â¦, which picks up angular momentum upon reflecting a circularly polarized incident beam.},

This approach enables us to apply the same truncation rules and techniques adopted in the Rabi model to the two qubits system. The derived analytical spectra match perfectly with the numerical solutions in the parameter regime where the qubits' transition frequencies are far off-resonance with the field frequency and the interaction strengths reach the ultrastrong coupling regime. We further explore the dynamical behavior of the two qubits as well as the evolution of entanglement. The analytical methods provide unexpectedly accurate results in describing the dynamics of the two qubits in the present experimentally accessible coupling regime. The time evolutions of the probability for the qubits show that the collapse-revival phenomena emerge, survive and finally disappear when one coupling strength increases from weak to strong coupling regimes and the other coupling strength is well into the ultrastrong coupling regime. The inhomogeneous coupling system exhibits new dynamics, which are different from the homogeneous coupling case.},

This guide is suitable for integrated optical circuitry because of its size, single-mode operation, mechanical stability, simplicity, and precise construction. After making some simplifying assumptions, we salve Maxwell's equations in closed form and find, that, because of total internal reflection, the guide supports two types of hybrid modes which are essentially of the TEM kind polarized (U right angles. Their attenuations are comparable to that of a plane wave traveling in the material of which the rod is made. If the refractive indexes are chosen properly, the guide can support only the fundamental modes of each family with any aspect ratio of the guide cross section. By adding thin lossy layers, the guide presents higher loss to one of those modes. As an alternative, the guide can be made to support only one of ike modes if part of the surrounding dielectrics is made a low impedance medium. Finally, we determine the coupling between parallel guiding rods of slightly different sizes and dielectrics; at wavelengths around one micron, S-dB directional couplers, a few hundred microns long, can be achieved with separations of the guides about the same as their widths (o few microns).},

This notion of effectively rendering states more coherent by driving with incoherent thermal quantum noise is applied here to the optomechanical setting, where this effect occurs most naturally. We discuss two ways of describing this situation, one of them making use of stochastic sampling of Gaussian quantum states with respect to stationary classical stochastic processes.

In addition to simulating neutrino oscillation in the noninteracting regime, our optical setting enables us to explore neutrino interactions in extreme regimes that are expected to play an important role in massive supernova stars. In particular, we predict the quenching of neutrino oscillations and the existence of topological defects, i.e., neutrino solitons, which in our photonic simulator should be observable as excitation of optical gap solitons propagating along the binary arrays at high excitation intensities.},

We derive a new fundamental cross section, namely, the one which gives the time-averaged torque caused by circularlypolarized illumination.

Formulation of the Maxwell stress dyad of the total (incident+ scattered) field gives the following torque relative to the sphere's center, I', =ILma Q,&, /tv. Here IL and cv are the incident wave's irradiance and angular frequency and a and Q,i„are the sphere s radius and Mie-theoretic absorption efficiency. Consequently the effective cross section for torque is the same as that for energy absorption era'Q, ~, as might be expected since the scattered radiation is shown to have the same ratio of z component of angular momentum to energy as the incident wave. This result is rigorous for stationary isotropic spheres in vacuo. It may be used to estimate the steady-state angular velocity co„of a sphere in a gas which is achieved when is balanced by the viscous-drag torque.

We demonstrate that, in general, the system can be reduced to an effective PT−symmetric dimer with asymmetric coupling. In the linear case, we find that there exist two modes with real propagation constants before an onset of the PT−symmetry breaking while other modes have always the propagation constants with nonzero imaginary parts. This leads to a stable (unstable) propagation of the modes when gain is localized in the core (ring) of the waveguiding structure. In the case of nonlinear response, we show that an interplay between nonlinearity, gain, and loss induces a high degree of instability, with only small windows in the parameter space where quasistable propagation is observed. We propose a novel stabilization mechanism based on a periodic modulation of both gain and loss along the propagation direction that allows bounded light propagation in the multicore waveguiding structures.},

The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or ''Boys orbitals'' as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

  Abstract                 = {The sensitive measurement of electrical signals is at the heart of modern technology. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, any detector or amplifier necessarily adds a certain amount of noise to the signal, equal to at least the noise added by quantum fluctuations1,2. This quantum limit of added noise has nearly been reached in superconducting devices that take advantage of nonlinearities in Josephson junctions3,4. Here we introduce the concept of the amplification of microwave signals using mechanical oscillation, which seems likely to enable quantum-limited operation. We drive a nanomechanical resonator with a radiation pressure force5â7, and provide an experimental demonstration and an analytical description of how a signal input to a microwave cavity induces coherent stimulated emission and, consequently, signal amplification. This generic scheme, which is based on two linear oscillators, has the advantage of being conceptually and practically simpler than the Josephson junction devices. In our device, we achieve signal amplification of 25 decibels with the addition of 20 quanta of noise, which is consistent with the expected amount of added noise. The generality of the model allows for realization in other physical systems as well, and we anticipate that near-quantumlimited mechanical microwave amplification will soon be feasible in various applications involving integrated electrical circuits.},

Successive ball positions are used to measure the dynamical parameters involved in snooker. Values for the rolling and the sliding coefficients of friction were found. The cushion-ball impact was studied for impacts perpendicular to the cushion. The separation angles and separation velocities after an oblique collision were measured and compared with predicted values. Our measurement technique is a simple, reliable, fast, and nonintrusive method, which can be used to test the numerous theories for the dynamics of billiards.

On the other hand these coefficients have Poincare cycles so that .any value which they take on is repeated an infinite number of times. It is shown that, in the case of fluctuations of o (N-t) from zero (N being the number of degrees of freedom), the period of Poincare cycles is of the order of the mean period of normal mode vibrations while for fluctuations of a magnitude independent of N the period is of the order of CN where C is a constant which is greater than 1.

We show that the combination of bi-chromatic optical lattices with Raman transitions can allow the engineering of a spin-dependent tunneling of the atoms between neighboring lattice sites. These assisted-hopping processes can be employed for the quantum simulation of various interesting models, ranging from noninteracting relativistic fermionic theories to topological insulators. We present a toolbox for the realization of different types of relativistic lattice fermions, which can then be exploited to synthesize a majority of phases in the periodic table of topological insulators.},

  Abstract                 = {For systems of interacting, ultracold spin-zero neutral bosonic atoms, harmonically trapped and subject to an optical lattice potential, we derive an Extended Bose Hubbard .EBH. model by developing a systematic expansion for the Hamiltonian of the system in powers of the lattice parameters and of a scale parameter, the lattice attenuation factor. We identify the dominant terms that need to be retained in realistic experimental conditions, up to nearest-neighbor interactions and nearest-neighbor hoppings conditioned by the on-site occupation numbers. In the mean field approximation, we determine the free energy of the system and study the phase diagram both at zero and at finite temperature. At variance with the standard on site Bose Hubbard model, the zero-temperature phase diagram of the EBH model possesses a dual structure in the Mott insulating regime. Namely, for specific ranges of the lattice parameters, a density wave phase characterizes the system at integer fillings, with domains of alternating mean occupation numbers that are the atomic counterparts of the domains of staggered magnetizations in an antiferromagnetic phase. We show as well that in the EBH model, a zero-temperature quantum phase transition to pair superfluidity is, in principle, possible, but completely suppressed at the lowest order in the lattice attenuation factor. Finally, we determine the possible occurrence of the different phases as a function of the experimentally controllable lattice parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Above a critical power threshold for a given pulse width, a short pulse of coherent traveling-wave optical radiation is observed to propagate with anomalously low energy loss while at resonance with a two-quantum-level system of absorbers. The line shape of the resonant system is determined by inhomogeneous broadening, and the pulse width is short compared to dissipative relaxation times. A new mechanism of self-induced transparency, which accounts for the low energy loss, is analyzed in the ideal limit of a plane wave which excites a resonant medium with no damping present. The stable condition of transparency results after the traversal of the pulse through a few classical absorption lengths into the medium. This condition exists when the initial pulse has evolved into a symmetric hyperbolic-secant pulse function of time and distance, and has the area characteristic of a "2$\pi$ pulse." Ideal transparency then persists when coherent induced absorption of pulse energy during the first half of the pulse is followed by coherent induced emission of the same amount of energy back into the beam direction during the second half of the pulse. The effects of dissipative relaxation times upon pulse energy, pulse area, and pulse delay time are analyzed to first order in the ratio of short pulse width to long damping time. The analysis shows that the 2$\pi$ pulse condition can be maintained if losses caused by damping are compensated by beam focusing. In an amplifying inhomogeneously broadened medium an analytic "$\pi$ pulse area" solution is presented in the limit of a sharp leading edge of the pulse. The dynamics of self-induced transparency are studied for the particular effects of Doppler velocities upon a resonant gas. The analysis of transparency for random orientations of dipole moments associated with degenerate rotational states yields modified forms of self-induced transparency behavior, which indicates a finite pulse energy loss as a function of distance in some cases. The effect of self-induced transparency on the photon echo is considered. Experimental observations of self-induced transparency have been made in a ruby sample at resonance with a pulsed ruby-laser beam. Single and multiple 2$\pi$ pulse outputs have been observed, and pulse areas measured in the range of 2$\pi$. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of the ideal-plane-wave theory. Deviations from the ideal-plane-wave theory are discussed. An analysis is made of the effect of a transverse mode of the propagating beam upon the transparency properties of the pulse.},

We study Landau-Zener transitions in our multimode systems and demonstrate quasiadiabatic loading of single photons into the multimode cavity in 25 ns. We introduce an adiabatic gate protocol to realize a controlled-Z gate between the qubits in 95 ns and create a Bell state with 94.7% fidelity.

Opt. B. Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 4 425), namely that one can observe entanglement without spin squeezing. Our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for entanglement, one associated with the two-photon coherences that create two-photon entangled states, and the other associated with populations of the collective states. We ﬁnd that the spin-squeezing parameter correctly predicts entanglement in the two-atom Dicke system only if it is associated with two-photon entangled states, but fails to predict entanglement when it is associated with the entangled symmetric state. This explicitly identiﬁes the source of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without spin squeezing. We illustrate these ﬁndings with three examples of the interaction of the system with thermal, classical squeezed vacuum, and quantum squeezed vacuum ﬁelds.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectacular experimental results of the last few years in cavity quantum electrodynamics and trapped-ion research has led to very-high-level laboratory performances. Such a stimulating situation essentially stems from two decisive advancements. The first is the invention of reliable protocols for the manipulation of single atoms. The second is the ability to produce desired bosonic environments on demand. This progress has led to the possibility of controlling the form of the coupling between individual atoms and an arbitrary number of bosonic modes. As a consequence, fundamental matter-radiation interaction models, for instance, the Jaynes-Cummings model and most of its numerous nonlinear multiphoton generalizations, have been realized or simu-lated in the laboratory and their dynamic features have been tested more or less in detail. This topical paper reviews the state of the art of the theoretical investigations and of the experimental observations concerning the dynamic features of the coupling between single few-level atoms and two bosonic modes. In the course of the paper we show that such a configuration provides an excellent platform for investigating various quantum intermode correlation effects tested or testable in the cavity quantum electrodynamics and trapped ion experimental realms. In particular we discuss a mode-mode correlation effect appearing in the dynamics of a two-level atom quadratically coupled to two bosonic modes. This effect, named the parity effect, consists of a highsensitivity to the evenness or oddness of the total number of bosonic excitations.},

The evidence shows that (i) the new index best explains trends in technology growth; (ii) the skillseducation deficit has increased in Africa and advanced OECD countries; (iii) the number of countries in poverty traps has risen; and (iv) valuable skills impact most on innovation when physical capital and skills are complementary.

In this situation, the atomic center-of-mass motion has to be treated quantum mechanically and the de Broglie wavelength of the atom inside the cavity is an important physical parameter. The interplay between reﬂection and transmission of the atoms leads to a new mechanism for induced emission. A photon is emitted by an excited atom when the de Broglie wavelength ﬁts resonantly into the cavity. These resonances lead to the process of microwave ampliﬁcation via z-motion-induced emission of radiation ~mazer!. We derive and illustrate a general expression for the emission probability and a master equation for the mazer. We note that the probability for emission by an excited thermal atom ~stimulated maser emission! is very different from the emission probability as given by the de Broglie resonances (induced mazer emission).},

The aim is to achieve quantum control of micromechanical and nanomechanical resonators using the electromagnetic field. Such control requieres the demonstration of state preparation (in particular, cooling to the ground state), coherent control and quantum-limited measurement. These problems are discussed in turn. Some particular problems in force detection, metrology, nonlinear optomechanics and many-body optomechanics are also discussed.},

The nature and interpretation of the mechanism depends on the choice of the states to represent the dynamics. Alternative representations may provide distinct insights into the system mechanism, and representations producing fewer pathways are especially interesting. In addition, a suitable choice of representation may highlight the role of certain couplings in a system that would normally be masked by other, higher magnitude couplings. A simple three-level system is chosen for illustration, where different values for the Rabi frequencies lead to mechanistic analyses that are best described in terms of particular representations.

  Abstract                 = {Closed-form analytical expressions for the electric and magnetic (EM) ﬁeld components of a high-order Bessel vortex beam of fractional typeα (HOBVB-Fα) are derived based on the axial polarization of the vector potentials [denoted by (z,−z)]. The ﬁelds’ components correspond to the most generalized case of quasi-standing-waves that reduce to perfect (i.e., equiamplitude) standing waves or progressive waves with appropriate choice of the quasi-standing-wave coefﬁcient 0  ϒ  1. The beam components are exact solutions of the vector wave equation (Helmholtz equation) and Maxwell’s equations. Moreover, computations of the EM components and comparison with the results obtained from a transverse polarization scheme [denoted by (x,−y)] illustrate the analysis. In addition, the time-averaged angular momentum density and ﬂux are evaluated with particular emphasis on the axial and transverse polarization states of the vector potentials. It is found that the quasi-standing-wave effect does not inﬂuence the spatial distributions of the EM components in the transverse polarization scheme (x,−y); however, it affects the transverse EM ﬁeld components in the axial polarization (z,−z). Moreover, both the linear and angular momenta density ﬂuxes are shown to reverse sign for a particular value of the half-cone angle β. These phenomena anticipate the production of a “tractor” beam where particulate matter may be pulled back toward the source, and a spinning reversal effect in which particulate matter may rotate with opposite handedness to a HOBVB-Fα. The results are particularly useful in applications involving optical laser tweezers, tractor beams, optical spanners, arbitrary scattering, radiation force, angular momentum, and torque.},

Then, comparing the probabilities of finding zero and one photon in the initial and final states of the field, one can draw conclusions on the form of the quantum jump operators. This scheme can be readily applied in a QED microwave cavity with the present-day technology, and it allows experimental investigations of the theory of quantum jumps due to different kinds of hypothetical reservoirs.},

Moreover, new experimental developments in the field of extreme nonlinear optics will require more rigorous propagation models beyond those existing in the current literature. Specific applications areas chosen for illustration in this paper include atmospheric light string propagation and nonlinear self-trapping in condensed media. These examples exhibit rather different aspects of intense femtosecond pulse propagation and demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the unidirectional Maxwell propagator. A novel aspect of our approach is that the pulse propagator is designed to faithfully capture the light-material interaction over the broad spectral landscape of relevance to the interaction. Moreover the model provides a seamless and physically selfconsistent means of deriving the many ultrashort pulse propagation equations presented in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {In many solids the intermolecular forces are sufficiently short ranged so that practically the entire potential energy of the system results from interactions between nearest neighbors. The thermodynamic properties of a solid with respect to a given coordinate, $\alpha$, (for example, in a ferromagnetic system $\alpha$ might represent the excess unpaired electron spin at a given lattice point; or in a substitutional binary alloy $\alpha$ might denote which of the two possible kinds of atoms are at a given lattice point) can be found from the factor of the partition function which averages over all possible configurations of $\alpha$ at all lattice points. Here the evaluation of such a factor of the partition function is reduced to the calculation of the largest characteristic value of a linear homogeneous operator equation involving the potential energy between two adjacent layers of lattice points in the solid. By assuming that all possible configurations of a layer are equally probable, a lower bound for the partition function for a simple cubic lattice is found in terms of the partition function of a cube of eight molecules. The operator equation for a real crystal becomes quite complex, but in some problems it is possible to obtain characteristic vectors and characteristic values (and thus the partition function) at high and low temperatures. For intermediate temperatures a theory of resonance between the low temperature ``almost ordered'' characteristic vectors and the high temperature ``almost disordered'' characteristic vectors is developed. In cases where the operator equation can be solved for microcrystals a few layers thick, a perturbation method is discussed in which interactions between the individual microcrystals are treated as perturbations. Some remarks are made concerning phase transitions and finally the general theory is applied to a superficial treatment of twoâdimensional ferromagnetic plates.},

In order to investigate the photon number splitting for the squeezed FHM, we have numerically calculated the qubit absorption spectrum, which exhibits regularly spaced peaks at frequencies separated by twice the effective dispersive shift. It is also shown that adding a small pump ﬁeld for the FHM makes additional peaks develop in between the dominant ones as well.},

The theory possesses no Hamiltonian and no Schrödinger picture. Photons can be created by the exciting effect of the moving mirrors on the zero‐point field energy. A calculation indicates that the number of photons created is immeasurably small for nonrelativistic mirror trajectories and continuous mirror velocities. Automorphic transformations of the wave equation are used to calculate mode functions for the cavity, and adiabatic expansions for these transformations are derived. The electromagnetic field may be coupled to matter by means of a transformation from the interaction picture to the Heisenberg picture; this transformation is generated by an interaction Hamiltonian.},

Such a mixed two-species insulator would be well suited for the formation of dipolar molecules via photoassociation. The resulting array of dipolar molecules could then be used for the formation of a dipolar molecular condensate or for computation. For the case of a 87Rb-41K two-species BEC, however, the large interspecies scattering length makes it difficult to obtain the desired mixed Mott-insulator phase. To overcome this difficulty, we investigate the effect of varying the lattice frequency on the mean-field interaction and propose a favorable parameter regime, under which a lattice of dipolar molecules could be generated.},

D 27, 2885 (1983)], and Gambini et al. for subsequent refinements [R. Gambini et al., Phys. Rev. D 79, 041501(R) (2009)]. A static, entangled state between a clock system and the rest of the universe is perceived as evolving by internal observers that test the correlations between the two subsystems. We implement this mechanism using an entangled state of the polarization of two photons, one of which is used as a clock to gauge the evolution of the second: An “internal” observer that becomes correlated with the clock photon sees the other system evolve, while an “external” observer that only observes global properties of the two photons can prove it is static.}

A more general statement is that the respective sets of $2\times 2$ Hermitian operators of the Fulton-Gouterman type and those diagonal in the spin subspace are unitary equivalent. The diagonalized representation makes it transparent that any question about integrability and solvability can be addressed only at the level of ordinary differential operators of Dunkl type.

It is shown here that the spectrum of the Rabi model coincides with the support of the discrete Stieltjes integral measure in the orthogonality relations of recently introduced orthogonal polynomials. The exactly solvable limit of the Rabi model corresponding to Δ=ω0/(2ωc)=0, which describes a displaced harmonic oscillator, is characterized by the discrete Charlier polynomials in normalized energy ϵ, which are orthogonal on an equidistant lattice. A non-zero value of Δ leads to non-classical discrete orthogonal polynomials ϕk(ϵ) and induces a deformation of the underlying equidistant lattice. The results provide a basis for a novel analytic method of solving the Rabi model. The number of ca. 1350 calculable energy levels per parity subspace obtained in double precision (cca 16 digits) by an elementary stepping algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude higher than is possible to obtain by Braak’s solution. Any first n eigenvalues of the Rabi model arranged in increasing order can be determined as zeros of ϕN(ϵ) of at least the degree N=n+nt. The value of nt>0, which is slowly increasing with n, depends on the required precision. For instance, nt≃26 for n=1000 and dimensionless interaction constant κ=0.2, if double precision is required. Given that the sequence of the lth zeros xnl’s of ϕn(ϵ)’s defines a monotonically decreasing discrete flow with increasing n, the Rabi model is indistinguishable from an algebraically solvable model in any finite precision. Although we can rigorously prove our results only for dimensionless interaction constant κ<1, numerics and exactly solvable example suggest that the main conclusions remain to be valid also for κ≥1.},

The polynomials pn(E) are orthonormal with respect to the density of states n0(E) and energy eigenstate E is the generating function of pn(E).

On applying the theory of orthogonal polynomials, the eigenvalue equation and eigenfunctions are shown to be determined in terms of three systems of monic orthogonal polynomials. The formal Schweber quantization criterion for an energy variable x, originally expressed in terms of infinite continued fractions, can be recast in terms of a meromorphic function View the MathML source in the complex plane C with real simple poles ξk and positive residues Mk. The zeros of F(x) on the real axis determine the spectrum of the Rabi model. One obtains at once that, on the real axis, (i) F(x) monotonically decreases from +∞ to −∞ between any two of its subsequent poles ξk and ξk+1, (ii) there is exactly one zero of F(x) for x∈(ξk,ξk+1), and (iii) the spectrum corresponding to the zeros of F(x) does not have any accumulation point. Additionally, one can provide a much simpler proof that the spectrum in each parity eigenspace B± is necessarily nondegenerate. Thereby the calculation of spectra is greatly facilitated. Our results allow us to critically examine recent claims regarding solvability and integrability of the Rabi model.},

Here we explore this concept for one-dimensional repulsive nonlinear SchrÂ¨ dinger equations, which o describe weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or light propagation in a nonlinear medium. It is shown that the dynamics of phase-space translations of the ground state of a harmonic potential is quite simple: The center follows a classical trajectory whereas its shape does not vary in time. The parabolic potential is the only one that satisfies this property. We study the time evolution of these nonlinear coherent states under perturbations of their shape or of the confining potential. A rich variety of effects emerges. In particular, in the presence of anharmonicities, we observe that the packet splits into two distinct components. A fraction of the wavepacket is transferred toward incoherent high-energy modes, while the amplitude of oscillation of the remaining coherent component is damped toward the bottom of the well.},

  Abstract                 = {By Bernoulli’s law, an increase in the relative speed of a ﬂuid around a body is accompanied by a decrease in the pressure. Therefore, a rotating body in a ﬂuid stream experiences a force perpendicular to the motion of the ﬂuid because of the unequal relative speed of the ﬂuid across its surface. It is well known that light has a constant speed irrespective of the relative motion. Does a rotating body immersed in a stream of photons experience a Bernoulli-like force? We show that, indeed, a rotating dielectric cylinder experiences such a lateral force from an electromagnetic wave. In fact, the sign of the lateral force is the same as that of the ﬂuid-mechanical analog as long as the electric susceptibility is positive (>0), but for negative-susceptibility materials (e.g., metals) we show that the lateral force is in the opposite direction. Because these results are derived from a classical electromagnetic scattering problem, Mie-resonance enhancements that occur in other scattering phenomena also enhance the lateral force.},

  Abstract                 = {Decoherence is a subject of great importance in quantum mechanics, particularly in the ﬁelds of quantum optics, quantum information processing and quantum computing. Quantum computation relies heavily in the unitary character of each step carried out by a quantum computational device and this unitarity is affected by decoherence. An extensive study of master equations is therefore needed for a better understanding on how quantum information is processed when a system interacts with its environment. Master equations are usually studied by using Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations and not much attention has been given to the use of superoperator techniques. In this report we study in detail several approaches that lead to decoherence, for instance a variation of the Schrödinger equation that models decoherence as the system evolves through intrinsic mechanisms beyond conventional quantum mechanics rather than dissipative interaction with an environment. For the study of the dissipative interaction we use a correspondence principle approach. We solve the master equations for different physical systems, namely, Kerr and parametric down conversion. In the case of light-matter interaction we show that although dissipation destroys the quantumness of the ﬁeld, information of the initial ﬁeld may be obtained via the reconstruction of quasiprobability distribution functions.},

Consequently, the shape of the phase distribution is preserved unless the number statistics are modified due to displacing it by subtraction onto the vacuum state. Starting with an initially coherent state one may realize pure quantum states displaying either amplitude or phase squeezing. The implementation of the method is based on interactions of the Jaynes±Cummings type, in the case of subtracting quanta one additionally needs to perform measurements on the electronic quantum state of the atoms.

  Abstract                 = {Trapped ions are considered one of the best candidates to perform quantum information processing. By interacting them with laser beams they are, somehow, easy to manipulate, which makes them an excellent choice for the production of nonclassical states of their vibrational motion, the reconstruction of quasiprobability distribution functions, the production of quantum gates, etc. However, most of these effects have been produced in the so-called low intensity regime, this is, when the Rabi frequency (laser intensity) is much smaller than the trap frequency. Because of the possibility to produce faster quantum gates in other regimes it is of importance to study this system in a more complete manner, which is the motivation for this contribution. We start by studying the way ions are trapped in Paul traps and review the basic mechanisms of trapping. Then we show how the problem may be completely solved for trapping states; i.e., we find (exact) eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian. We show how, in the low intensity regime, Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions may be obtained, without using the rotating wave approximation and analyze the medium and high intensity regimes where dispersive Hamiltonians are produced. The traditional approach (low intensity regime) is also studied and used for the generation of non-classical states of the vibrational wavefunction. In particular, we show how to add and subtract vibrational quanta to an initial state, how to produce specific superpositions of number states and how to generate NOON states for the two-dimensional vibration of the ion. It is also shown how squeezing may be measured. The time dependent problem is studied by using Lewis-Ermakov methods. We give a solution to the problem when the time dependence of the trap is considered and also analyze a specific (artificial) time dependence that produces squeezing of the initial vibrational wave function. A way to mimic the ion-laser interaction via classical optics is also introduced.},

Our approximation technique involves a decoupling of the hierarchy of Green function equations similar in some respects to that found in the random phase approximation (RPA) but improved to include spin correlations neglected in the RPA. Such an inmprovement is essential for the two-dimensional problem. Our theory predicts a phase transition at the temperature given bby kTc = 2 J, where J is the exchange parameter. As T approaches Tc from above, the static susceptibility diverges as 1/(T - Tc). The spontaneous magnetization is zero at all nonzero temperatures, both above and below the critical point. Therefore, our theory is consistent with the existing rigorous proof of Mermin and Wagner that the spontaneous magnetization must be zero for T!=0, and displays the divergent susceptibility predicted by Stanley and Kaplan fro an alaysis of high-temperature expansions for related two-dimensional spin systems.},

The cavity-mode structure selects a particular collective vibrational motion that is measured by the cavity’s optical properties, actuated by the cavity optical ﬁeld and subject to backaction by the quantum force ﬂuctuations of this ﬁeld. Experimentally, we quantify such ﬂuctuations by measuring the cavity-light-induced heating of the intracavity atomic ensemble.

We start with an initial coherent state which is neither squeezed nor entangled; however, it gains both properties as it is evolved by the Hamiltonian. Both squeezing and entanglement show an oscillatory behavior in time and stronger Hamiltonians correspond to smaller oscillation periods. Generation of almost continuous squeezing according to Kitagawa criterion seems feasible; however, off and on squeezing death is observed according to that of Wineland. The entanglement is diminished as the size of the system is increased, implying that the generation of strong entanglement in large multi-qutrit systems, instigated by the counter-twisting Hamiltonian, may not be feasible. Application of a magnetic field may have adverse effect on both squeezing and entanglement.},

Mode multiplexing is achieved by adiabatic transition from the fundamental mode of the single-mode waveguide to the higher mode of the multimode waveguide.

The analogous term 'circuit QED' has been introduced for Josephson junctions, because superconducting circuits behave as artificial atoms coupled to the bosonic field of a resonator. In the regime with Ω0 comparable with the two-level transition frequency, 'superradiant' quantum phase transitions for the cavity vacuum have been predicted, for example, within the Dicke model. In this study, we prove that if the time-independent light-matter Hamiltonian is considered, a superradiant quantum critical point is forbidden for electric dipole atomic transitions because of the oscillator strength sum rule. In circuit QED, the analogous of the electric dipole coupling is the capacitive coupling, and such no-go property can be circumvented by Cooper pair boxes capacitively coupled to a resonator, because of their peculiar Hilbert space topology and a violation of the corresponding sum rule.},

Our analytical results show that the Bloch-like oscillations appear above a critical value for the linear gradient of the propagation constant (α>αc ). The phase transition (in the propagation properties of the waveguide) is a result of competition between discrete and Bragg diffraction. Moreover, the light intensity decays algebraically along each waveguide at the critical point while it falls off exponentially below the critical point (α<αc).},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the eigenenergy spectrum of the intensity-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model with and without the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Our analysis has indicated that the counter-rotating term dramatically changes the nature of the RWA energy spectrum and that the non-RWA spectrum can be approximated by the RWA spectrum only in the range of a sufficiently small coupling constant. Furthermore, the intensity-dependent JC model without the RWA is well defined only if the coupling parameter is below a certain critical value. As a result, the dynamics of the intensity-dependent JC model without the RWA is significantly different from its RWA counterpart. For instance, the counter-rotating term can dramatically enhance the field squeezing effect. Furthermore, we believe that our results are of immediate relevance to the system of a trapped and laser-irradiated ion, which has been shown to exhibit an intensity-dependent JC dynamics recently},

  Abstract                 = {The operations of three-guide couplers are usually controlled by the width and refractive index of the guides. However, when rib waveguides are used in three-guide couplers and power dividers, we propose to use the dimensions of the ribs as the governing parameters instead. Formulating a new transcendental equation using the discrete spectral index (DSI) method, triple rib waveguide couplers are accurately analyzed for the ﬁrst time. The new accurate and fast analysis of triple rib waveguides shows that the propagation constants of the various modes are dominantly controlled by the height of the middle rib. A systematic and simple procedure is consequently introduced to design quasi-transverse electric (TE) polarized triple rib waveguide couplers, which ensures maximum power transfer from one outermost guide to the other outermost guide. For triple rib power dividers, the height of the middle rib is found to control the amount of power that can be transferred from the excited middle rib waveguide to the two outer rib waveguides. Maximum power division is achieved when the three ribs of the waveguide are identical.},

  Abstract                 = {Intense light can exert a mechanical action on the motion of atoms in two quite distinct ways. The resonance radiation force is based upon the exchange of photon momentum between an atom and the radiation field. The phenomenon of light-induced drift results from the difference in mobility of excited and ground-state atoms in a buffer gas. We derive the relevant equations of motion for the atomic distribution function, by applying a systematic formulation of time-dependent degenerate perturbation theory. For the resonance radiation force, we obtain a FokkerâPlanck equation for the velocity distribution of atoms in one or several light beams, while including the degeneracy of the atomic levels. The derivation generalizes previous results, and it clarifies the physical origin of the various terms. Likewise we obtain a diffusion-type equation for the density of atoms which contains light-induced drift, and we obtain explicit solutions in several model cases of practical interest. These solutions demonstrate the front formation that produces the effect of the optical piston in an optically thick system. Finally we discuss the differences and the analogies between the two effects.},

The paraxial optics analog of a coherent state is shown to be a light beam with a displaced beam axis iwhich is refracted by lenses according to geometric optics. The expectation value of the orbital angular momentum of a paraxial beam of light is found to be expressible in terms of a contribution analogous to the angular momentum of the oscillator plus contributions which arise from the ellipticity of the wave fronts and of the light spot. This clarifies the process by which a transfer of orbital angular momentum between a light beam and astigmatic lenses or diaphragms occur.},

After a brief overview of the physical mechanisms at the basis of attosecond pulse generation, the experimental methods used for the production of isolated sub-femtosecond pulses are discussed, with particular emphasis on the polarization gating method, which is based on the use of driving pulses with a time-dependent polarization state. The recent emergence of attosecond metrology is described and various techniques for temporal characterization of extreme ultraviolet pulses in the sub-femtosecond regime are analyzed. The streak-camera approach turned out to be an extremely powerful method: all applications of isolated attosecond pulses reported so far are essentially based on such experimental approach. We furthermore discuss recently proposed applications of isolated attosecond pulses in various research fields. Particularly interesting will be the application of attosecond pulses to the investigation of multielectron systems. The collective electronic motion in complex systems and the electron correlation mechanisms represent fundamental problems in atomic and molecular physics, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view: the application of attosecond pulses promises to offer a formidable tool for the experimental investigation of such fundamental physical processes. Moreover the possibility to directly measure and control the ultrafast charge migration process in complex molecules, which is at the basis of fundamental processes in nature, can open the way to the emergence of attochemistry, with important consequences both for fundamental research and technology. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the term Majoranon to describe particles that obey the Majorana equation, which are different from the Majorana fermions widely studied in various physical systems. A general procedure to simulate the corresponding Majoranon dynamics, based on a decomposition of the Majorana equation into two Dirac equations, is described in detail. It allows the simulation of the two-component chiral spinors, the building blocks of modern gauge theories, in the laboratory with current technology. Specifically, a Majoranon in one spatial dimension can be simulated with a single qubit plus a continuous degree of freedom, for example, a single trapped ion. Interestingly, the dynamics of a Majoranon deviates most clearly from that of a Dirac particle in the rest frame, in which the continuous variable is redundant, making a possible laboratory implementation feasible with existing setups.},

However, it cannot be called a “tractor beam” per se, as long as the light pulling effect is ultrasensitive to the object’s material and size, a perturbation of which will make the optical traction go away. In this Letter, we investigate and report on the universality for a Bessel beam to be either a material-independent or size-independent optical tractor beam within the dipolar regime. Moreover, a general condition for a nonparaxial laser to be simultaneously a material- and size-independent tractor beam is proposed. These universal pulling effects and conditions are discussed in association with insight on modified far-field scattering, scattering resonances, and induced polarizabilities. Interestingly, we find that the acoustic pulling force exhibits only size independence, owing to the acoustic scattering theory in contrast to the light scattering counterpart. The findings pave the way for the realistic engineering and application of universal tractor beams pulling a wide variety of objects.}

The major criterion of realizing the backward dragging force is the strong nonparaxiality of the light beam, which contributes to the pulling force owing to momentum conservation. The nonparaxiality of the Bessel beam can be manipulated to possess a dragging force along both the radial longitudinal directions, i.e., a ‘‘tractor beam’’ with stable trajectories is achieved.},

An optical dynamic system is described by the three first-order differential equations for the image point, with the tangent to the image point trajectory being the Poynting vector. Important feature of the Poynting singularities is the existence of the polarization-induced singularities (arise due to the specific field polarization) along with the field-induced ones (appear owing to the vanishing the fields). We analyze not only isolated critical points, but the manifolds of singularities forming lines and surfaces as well. We define the types of the singular points (vortex, saddle, sink, source, and focus) using the trace and determinant of the stability matrix. Such a criterion and the study of the dependence on parameter (bifurcations) are applied for a number of examples. We offer to study the chaotic dynamic of the image point in future.}

Using this method, the effect of a subcycle pulse (containing less than a single period of field oscillations) on the two-level medium was analyzed. It is shown that for such short pulses, the clear breakdown of the area theorem occurs for the pulses of large enough area.

  Abstract                 = {In a section through a monochromatic light beam the contour map of phase contains saddle points. It has already been shown that a two-dimensional model of two superposed coaxial Gaussian beams, in antiphase and having different waist sizes, contains two saddles that perform an elaborate dance as the ratio of the amplitudes of the beams is altered. The present paper explains why this choreography is qualitatively identical to that found in a symmetrical version of an earlier and simpler two-dimensional model, where a plane wave is modulated by a quadratic polynomial. If wavefronts are defined as lines of equal phase, successive wavefronts pinch together in these models, and change their connectedness as they pass through two fixed saddle points on the axis. Although the idea of a phase saddle is not generally applicable in three dimensions, it can be extended to three dimensions in axially symmetric models, for example, two superposed coaxial Gaussian beams. The saddles are features of the set of azimuthal planes, and can either form rings around the axis or be on the axis itself. The action here as a parameter changes takes a more dramatic form, because it involves both a vortex ring and two saddle points on the axis, which collide and explode into a concentric saddle ring. The physical significance of saddles is that they change the topology of the wavefronts. In two dimensions a moving wavefront line passing through a fixed saddle point on the axis undergoes reconnection. As it meets an off-axis saddle the same process occurs but in a different orientation. In three dimensions as a wavefront passes through a saddle point on the axis, its local form changes from a hyperboloid of two sheets to a hyperboloid of one sheet, or vice versa, via a cone of angle 2 tan-1 â 2 = 109â¦. As it passes through a saddle ring a similar transition occurs simultaneously at all points of the ring. The changes in the topology of a wavefront as it encounters a monkey saddle are also interesting. The behaviour of the saddle points and rings in two superposed three-dimensional Gaussian beams is also similar to that found in a simpler quadratic polynomial model.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate highly efficient switching of optical signals between two optical fibers controlled by a single atom. The key element of our experiment is a whispering-gallery-mode bottle microresonator, which is coupled to a single atom and interfaced by two tapered fiber couplers. This system reaches the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, leading to a vacuum Rabi splitting in the excitation spectrum. We systematically investigate the switching efficiency of our system, i.e., the probability that the fiber-optical switch redirects the light into the desired output. We obtain a large redirection efficiency reaching a raw fidelity of more than 60% without postselection. Moreover, by measuring the second-order correlation functions of the output fields, we show that our switch exhibits a photon-number-dependent routing capability.}

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of a system composed of two coupled cavities, each containing a single two-level atom, is studied over a wide range of detuning and coupling values. A description of the field in terms of delocalized modes reveals that the detuning between the atoms and these modes is controlled by the coupling between the cavities; this detuning in turn governs the nature of the dynamics. If the atoms are highly detuned from both delocalized field modes, the dynamics become dispersive and an excitation may be transferred from the first atom to the second without populating the field. In the case of resonance between the atoms and one of the delocalized modes, state transfer between the atoms requires intermediate excitation of the field. ThThus, the interaction between the two atoms can be controlled by adjusting the coupling between the cavities.},

The number-state field prepared in suach a way may be transformed by the action of a displacement operator; for the microwave micromaser state this could be implemented by the action of a classical current that drives the cavity field. We evaluate some properties of such displaced number states, especially their description in phase space. The photon number distribution is shown to display unusual oscillations, which are interpreted as interference in phase space, analogous to Franck-Condon oscillations in molcular spectra. The possibility of detecting these oscillations is discussed, through the photodetection counting statistics of the displaced number states. We show that the displaced-number-state quantum features are relatively robust when dissipation of the field energy is included.},

The complexity of the typical observations of superradiance, however, masks its quantum nature, allowing alternative classical interpretations. Here we stress how this picture changed with the implementation ten years ago of a new process for single-photon generation from atomic ensembles. We present then the last piece of evidence for the superradiant nature of such a process, reporting the observation of an accelerated emission of the photon with a rate that may be tuned by controllably changing the number of atoms in the ensemble. We hope such an investigation will help open up a new bottom-up approach to the study of superradiance.},

A local nonlinear S-wave scattering interaction has the effect of creating spin squeezing at each well, while a tunneling coupling, analogous to a beam splitter in optics, introduces an interference between these fields that causes interwell entanglement. We consider two internal modes at each well so that the entanglement can be detected by measuring a reduction in the variances of the sums of local Schwinger spin observables. As is typical of continuous variable (CV) entanglement, the entanglement is predicted to increase with atom number. It becomes sufficiently strong at higher numbers of atoms so that the EPR paradox and steering nonlocality can be realized. The entanglement is predicted using an analytical approach and, for larger atom numbers, using stochastic simulations based on a truncated Wigner function approximation. We find generally that strong tunneling is favorable, and that entanglement persists and is even enhanced in the presence of realistic nonlinear losses.},

Furthermore, all irreducibly balanced states are genuinely multi-qudit entangled and are locally equivalent with respect to SL(d) transformations (i.e. the local filtering transformations) to a maximally entangled state. In particular the concept given here gives a condition that all maximal genuinely multi-qudit entangled states for general local Hilbert space dimension d have to satisfy. A general genuinely multi-qudit entangled state is an element of the partly balanced SU(d)-orbits.}

However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit much richer dynamics. A prominent example2,3 is the predicted ability of a single atom to produce quadrature-squeezed light4, which has fluctuations of amplitude or phase that are below the shot-noise level. However, such squeezing is much more difficult to observe than the emission of single photons5. Squeezed beams have been generated using macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms6, but despite experimental efforts7â9, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation. Here we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical resonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a genuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity10, which is several orders of magnitude larger than in typical macroscopic media11â13. This produces observable quadrature squeezing14â16, with an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system lifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons17, the squeezed light stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system18. The ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between propagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with single emitters},

  Abstract                 = {The transition from quantum to classical, in the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator, is typically identified with the transition from a quantum superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states, such as the Schrodinger-cat state, into the corresponding statistical mixture. This transition is commonly characterized by the asymptotic loss of the interference term in the Wigner representation of the cat state. In this paper we show that the quantum-to-classical transition has different dynamical features depending on the measure for nonclassicality used. Measures based on an operatorial definition have well-defined physical meaning and allow a deeper understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our analysis shows that, for most nonclassicality measures, the Schrodinger-cat state becomes classical after a finite time. Moreover, our results challenge the prevailing idea that more macroscopic states are more susceptible to decoherence in the sense that the transition from quantum to classical occurs faster. Since nonclassicality is a prerequisite for entanglement generation our results also bridge the gap between decoherence, which is lost only asymptotically, and entanglement, which may show a "sudden death." In fact, whereas the loss of coherences still remains asymptotic, we emphasize that the transition from quantum to classical can indeed occur at a finite time.},

One of the key aspects to the work is the change in direction of the incident plane wave, and the marked increase in the numerical aperture demonstrated. Hence, the optically steered waveguide can tap from a relatively broader beam and then generate a more tightly confined light at its tip. The paper contains both simulation, related to the propagation of light through the waveguide, and experimental demonstrations using our BioPhotonics Workstation. In a broader context, this work shows that optically trapped microfabricated structures can potentially help bridge the diffraction barrier. This structure-mediated paradigm may be carried forward to open new possibilities for exploiting beams from far-field optics down to the subwavelength domain.},

In this work, we analyse counter-propagating shaped-beam traps that depart from the conventional geometry based on symmetric, coaxial counter-propagating beams. We show that projecting shaped beams with separation distances previously considered axially unstable can, in fact, enhance the axial and transverse trapping stiffnesses. We also show that deviating from using perfectly counter-propagating beams to use oblique beams can improve the axial stability of the traps and improve the axial trapping stiffness. These alternative geometries can be particularly useful for handling larger particles. These results hint at a rich potential for light shaping for optical trapping and manipulation using patterned counter-propagating beams, which still remains to be fully tapped.},

A onedimensional classical electrostatic analog corresponding to the special LMG model is established according to Stieltjesâ early work. It shows that any possible configuration of equilibrium positions of the charges in the electrostatic problem corresponds uniquely to one set of roots of the Bethe ansatz equations for the LMG model, and the number of possible configurations of equilibrium positions of the charges equals exactly the number of energy levels in the LMG model. Some relations of sums of powers and inverse powers of zeros of the new polynomials related to the eigenenergies of the LMG model are derived.},

We show that, under these assumptions, the measured delay is the group delay, and that it is apparently 'superluminal' for sufficiently thick air gaps. We also show how an HOM signal with multiple minima can be obtained, and that the shape of such a signal is not appreciably affected by the presence of the optical tunneling zone, thus ruling out the explanation of the anomalously short tunneling delays in terms of a reshaping of the wavepacket as it goes through the tunneling zone. Finally, we compare the predicted tunneling delay to a relevant classical delay and conclude that our predictions involve no non-causal effect.},

One such example is the TonksâGirardeau gas1,2, proposed about 40 years ago, but until now lacking experimental realization; in such a gas, the repulsive interactions between bosonic particles confined to one dimension dominate the physics of the system. In order to minimize their mutual repulsion, the bosons are prevented from occupying the same position in space. This mimics the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions, causing the bosonic particles to exhibit fermionic properties1,2.However, such bosons do not exhibit completely ideal fermionic (or bosonic) quantum behaviour; for example, this is reflected in their characteristic momentum distribution3. Here we report the preparation of a TonksâGirardeau gas of ultracold rubidium atoms held in a twodimensional optical lattice formed by two orthogonal standing waves. The addition of a third, shallower lattice potential along the long axis of the quantum gases allows us to enter the Tonksâ Girardeau regime by increasing the atomsâ effective mass and thereby enhancing the role of interactions.We make a theoretical prediction of the momentum distribution based on an approach in which trapped bosons acquire fermionic properties, finding that it agrees closely with the measured distribution.},

When the ratio of the number of atoms to the spin degeneracy is an integer number, the ground state for the effective fermions is an integer quantum Hall state. The corresponding bosonic state is a fractional quantum Hall liquid whose filling factor ranges in the sequence $\nu =$1/2,2/3,3/4, . . . , as the spin degeneracy increases. Anyons with 1/2,1/3,1/4, . . . statistics can be created by inserting lasers with the appropriate polarizations. A special situation appears when the spin degeneracy equals the number of atoms in the gas. The ground state is then the product of a completely antisymmetric spin state and a â¯ Ï­1 Laughlin state.

We show that the Bloch part of the equation can be solved identically through g and the remaining Maxwell equation becomes a second-order differential equation with a reduced set of variables due to the gauge invariance of the system. Our formulation clarifies the non-Abelian symmetry structure of the Maxwell-Bloch equations for various multilevel media in association with symmetric spaces G/H. In particular, we associate the nondegenerate two-level system for self-induced transparency with G/HÏ­SU2/U1 and three-level â³ or V systems with G/HÏ­SU3/U2. We give a detailed analysis for the two-level case in the matrix potential formalism, and address various properties of the system including soliton numbers, effective potential energy, gauge and discrete symmetries, modified pulse area, conserved topological, and nontopological charges. The nontopological charge measures the amount of self-detuning of each pulse. Its conservation law leads to a different type of pulse stability analysis that explains earlier numerical results.},

  Abstract                 = {The usual mathematical model of the single-mode electromagnetic field is the harmonic oscillator with an infinite-dimensional state space, which unfortunately cannot accommodate the existence of a Hermitian phase operator. Recently we indicated that this difficulty may be circumvented by using an alternative, and physically indistinguishable, mathematical model of the ingle-mode field involving a finite but arbitrarily large state space, the dimension of which is allowed to tend to infinity after physically tneasurable results, such as expectation values, are calculated. In this paper we investigate the properties of a Hermitian phase operator which follows directly and uniquely from the form of the phase states in this space and find them to be well behaved. The phase-number commutator is not subject to the difficulties inherent in Dirac's original commutator, but still preserves the commutator —Poisson-bracket correspondence for physical field states. In the quantum regime of small field strengths, the phase operator predicts phase properties substantially different from those obtained using the conventional Susskind-Glogower operators. In particular, our results are consistent with the vacuum being a state of random phase and the phases of two vacuum fields being uncorrelated. For higher-intensity fields, the quantum phase properties agree with those previously obtained by phenomenological and semiclassical approaches, where such approximations are valid. We illustrate the properties of the phase with a discussion of partial phase states. The Hermitian phase operator also allows us to construct a unitary number-shift operator and phase-moment generating functions. We conclude that the alternative mathematical description of the single-mode field presented here provides a valid, and potentially useful, quantum-mechanical approach for calculating the phase properties of the electromagnetic field.},

For identical qubit–photon couplings, a novel type of quasi-exact solution which exists for all coupling values with constant eigenenergy is found, leading to level crossings within the same parity subspace even for non-identical qubits. In contrast to the quasi-exact eigenstates of the single-qubit model, these exceptional eigenstates are formed by just a few Fock states (photon number bounded from above at one or three), and the condition for them depends only on a fine-tuning of the qubit level splittings with respect to the photon energy, but not on the coupling to the photon field if the qubit–qubit interaction is not taken into consideration. This makes them excellent candidates for direct experimental observation within circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) and application in single photon experiments. Besides, exceptional solutions with finite photon numbers N are also found.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the interaction of the Airy–Gaussian (AiG) beams by using the numerical simulations with the split-step Fourier method. The results show that the single breathers and breather pairs can be formed in the condition with interaction. The breathers can be formed with the enough intensity of interactive beams. By adjusting the parameters of amplitude, interval, phase and χ0, we find that the interaction of the two beams is the strongest with in-phase and out-of-phase cases, especially in the shorter distance. Moreover, both the interaction intensity and the location, the interaction happens, can be changed by adjusting the distribution factor χ0 of the beams. It is notable that the various propagation directions of the beams can be obtained by changing the phase, at the same situation, when the interval of the two beams becomes narrower, the phase plays an important role of controlling the direction of the accelerated spot.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a perturbative analysis of a Rabi model where the coupling between the quantized single-mode electromagnetic field and the two-level atom depends on the field intensity. Upon modeling the matter–radiation coupling through the Holstein–Primakoff realization of algebra su(1,1), we evaluate first- and second-order eigenenergies and eigenstates both in the weak-coupling regime (atom transition frequency smaller than the coupling strength) and in the strong-coupling regime. In the first case, among various effects, we observe a quadratic dependence on the photon number of energy eigenvalues and the possible formation of level doublets. In the strong-coupling case, the perturbative analysis becomes considerably complex due to the su(1,1)-valued form of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. The critical condition for the transition to an almost continuous spectrum is found in terms of the model parameters.},

Unlike the customary approach, based on the interaction picture and the rotating wave approximation, we reduce the original Hamiltonian to a time-independent model, unitarily equivalent to a spin-boson model, which features a form well suited to apply the perturbation theory. We determine the first- and second-order corrections of eigenstates and eigenvalues. By varying the interaction parameters we identify four regimes characterized by different eigenvalue distributions (possibly including level doublets) and suggest the presence of an intermediate regime where the spectrum undergoes macroscopic changes. In this regime, where the perturbation approach does not hold, our reduced Hamiltonian is shown to reproduce the Jaynes–Cummings model.},

This asymptotic condition and the time periodicity of the Hamiltonian lead to time-independent expressions for the distribution of the kinetic energy in the relative motion of the fragments for a half-collision and for a full-collision experiment. These expressions are combined with the complex-coordinate method to give an efficient numerical algorithm for the calculation of multiphoton ionization-dissociation probabilities within the framework of the finite-range-potential approximations. The theory is applied to a model Hamiltonian of an atom in a strong ac field. The obtained above-threshold-ionization spectra are in excellent agreement with theoretical results previously obtained from time-dependent calculations.},

The linear dimensions of the spot may be considerably smaller than the radiation wavelength and their reduction is due to the decrease in the fraction of the energy concentrated in the spot. The longitudinal distribution of the field intensity has a fine structure with linear dimensions comparable with the radiation wavelength.

  Abstract                 = {A simple conserved quantity for electromagnetic fields in vacuum was discovered by Lipkin in 1964. In recent years, this “zilch” has been used as a measure of the chirality of light. The conservation of optical zilch is here derived from a simple symmetry of the standard electromagnetic action. The symmetry transformation allows the identification of circularly polarized plane waves as zilch eigenstates. The same symmetry is present for electromagnetism in a homogeneous, dispersive medium, allowing the derivation of the zilch density and flux in such a medium. Optical helicity density and flux are also derived for a homogeneous, dispersive medium. For monochromatic beams in vacuum, optical zilch is proportional to optical helicity. This monochromatic zilch-helicity relation acquires a factor of the square of the phase index in a dispersive medium.},

This has led to a phenomenological approach to macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where no canonical formulation is attempted. In this paper macroscopic electromagnetism is canonically quantized. The results apply to any linear, inhomogeneous, magnetodielectric medium with dielectric functions that obey the Kramers–Kronig relations.

We study these effects in a two-photon model in which the time evolution is exactly periodic. We study the field entropy in two two-photon cases and link the fluctuations in the field phase to the changes in the field entropy. We also calculate the statistical Q function of the field and show how the periodicity of the two-photon dynamics is linked to a periodic splitting of the Q function in phase space. Finally this periodicity is linked to the nature of the atom-field dressed states involved in two-photon resonance.},

We show that such a state can be isolated in the course of free evolution from any initial state by a null-result measurement in the reservoir, or it can be reached without such a measurement in the many-body case. The resulting superposition is regulated by the ratio of couplings between the wells and the reservoir. In particular, one can lock the system in one of the wells by enhancing this ratio. By tuning parameters of the quantum wells, many-body entangled states in distant wells can be produced through interactions and statistics.},

This type of reentrance is displayed by the Bose-Hubbard model in one spatial dimension between its Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid phase as the hopping amplitude is increased from zero. Here we analyze this counterintuitive phenomenon directly in the thermodynamic limit by utilizing the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm to variationally minimize an infinite matrix product state (MPS) parameterized by a matrix size $\chi$ . Exploiting the direct restriction on the half-chain entanglement imposed by fixing $\chi$ , we determined that reentrance in the MI lobes only emerges in this approximation when $\chi$ 8. This entanglement threshold is found to be coincident with the ability of an infinite MPS to be simultaneously particle-number symmetric and capture the kinetic energy carried by particle-hole excitations above the MI. Focusing on the tip of the MI lobe, we then applied a general finite-entanglement scaling analysis of the infinite-order Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) critical point located there. By analyzing values of $\chi$ up to a very moderate $\chi$ = 70, we obtained an estimate of the KT transition as tKT = 0.30 ± 0.01, demonstrating how a finite-entanglement approach can provide not only qualitative insight but also quantitatively accurate predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Plasma channel generation (or filamentation) using ultraintense laser pulses in dielectric media has a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from remote sensing to terahertz generation to lightning control. So far, laser filamentation has been triggered with the use of ultrafast pulses with axially symmetric spatial beam profiles, thereby generating straight filaments. We report the experimental observation of curved plasma channels generated in air using femtosecond Airy beams. In this unusual propagation regime, the tightly confined main intensity feature of the axially nonsymmetric laser beam propagates along a bent trajectory, leaving a curved plasma channel behind. Secondary channels bifurcate from the primary bent channel at several locations along the beam path. The broadband radiation emanating from different longitudinal sections of the curved filament propagates along angularly resolved trajectories.},

The optimal strategy for resolving a weak stochastic signal force on a huge background (typically given by thermal noise) is a crucial and debated topic, and the stability of the mechanical resonance is a further, related critical issue. We introduce and analyze the parametric control of the optical spring, which allows us to stabilize the resonance and provides a phase reference for the oscillator motion, yet conserving a free evolution in one quadrature of the phase space. We also study quantitatively the characteristics of our micro-optomechanical system as detector of stochastic force for short measurement times (for quick, high-resolution monitoring) as well as for the longer-term observations that optimize the sensitivity. We compare a simple strategy based on the evaluation of the variance of the displacement which is a widely used technique) with an optimal Wiener-Kolmogorov data analysis. We show that, due to the parametric stabilization of the effective susceptibility, we can more efficiently implement Wiener filtering, and we investigate how this strategy improves the performance of our system. We finally demonstrate the possibility to resolve stochastic force variations well below 1% of the thermal noise.},

  Abstract                 = {Mechanical systems are ideal candidates for studying quantum behavior of macroscopic objects. To this end, a mechanical resonator has to be cooled to its ground state and its position has to be measured with great accuracy. Currently, various routes to reach these goals are being explored. In this review, we discuss different techniques for sensitive position detection and we give an overview of the cooling techniques that are being employed. The latter includes sideband cooling and active feedback cooling. The basic concepts that are important when measuring on mechanical systems with high accuracy and/or at very low temperatures, such as thermal and quantum noise, linear response theory, and backaction, are explained. From this, the quantum limit on linear position detection is obtained and the sensitivities that have been achieved in recent opto- and nanoelectromechanical experiments are compared to this limit. The mechanical resonators that are used in the experiments range from meter-sized gravitational wave detectors to nanomechanical systems that can only be read out using mesoscopic devices such as single-electron transistors or superconducting quantum interference devices. A special class of nanomechanical systems is bottom-up fabricated carbon-based devices, which have very high frequencies and yet a large zero-point motion, making them ideal for reaching the quantum regime. The mechanics of some of the different mechanical systems at the nanoscale is studied. We conclude this review with an outlook of how state-of-the-art mechanical resonators can be improved to study quantum mechanics.},

  Abstract                 = {We theoretically investigate the process of coupling cold atoms into the core of a hollow-core photonic-crystal optical fiber using a blue-detuned Laguerre-Gaussian beam. In contrast to the use of a red-detuned Gaussian beam to couple the atoms, the blue-detuned hollow beam can confine cold atoms to the darkest regions of the beam, thereby minimizing shifts in the internal states and making the guide highly robust to heating effects. This single optical beam is used as both a funnel and a guide to maximize the number of atoms into the fiber. In the proposed experiment, Rb atoms are loaded into a magneto-optical trap (MOT) above a vertically oriented optical fiber. We observe a gravito-optical trapping effect for atoms with high orbital momentum around the trap axis, which prevents atoms from coupling to the fiber: these atoms lack the kinetic energy to escape the potential and are thus trapped in the laser funnel indefinitely.We find that by reducing the dipolar force to the point at which the trapping effect just vanishes, it is possible to optimize the coupling of atoms into the fiber. Our simulations predict that by using a low-power (2.5 mW) and far-detuned (300 GHz) Laguerre-Gaussian beam with a 20-$\mu$m-radius core hollow fiber, it is possible to couple 11% of the atoms from a MOT 9 mm away from the fiber. When the MOT is positioned farther away, coupling efficiencies over 50% can be achieved with larger core fibers.},

  Abstract                 = {An examination is made of the Green dyadic for the propagation functions of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics in the Coulomb gauge div A = 0. The existence of false precursors is shown to be associated with singularities at the origin in certain momentum space representations of the propagators and this allows a prescription to be given to eliminate such precursors. This prescription is proved equivalent to an exact consideration of the near fields associated with quantum transitions. The analogous treatment for the state vectors in decaying systems is carried through and is applied in detail to the problems of the shape of natural spectral lines and the transition rate for stimulated emission. It is shown that the expected line shape for the Lamb 1057 Mc/s line in hydrogen is Lorentzian within the context of Lamb's experiments-intensity against Zeeman splitting energy. This is in contradiction to the predictions of Arnous and Heitler. The distribution in k (circular frequency) for a natural line, on the other hand, has a factor k$^{3}$ times the resonant denominator. The definitive position between the conflicting transition rates in the literature is given. The relationship of the calculations to a gauge-independent Hamiltonian, considered in the paper, is investigated in detail. This Hamiltonian, transformed canonically from the conventional one, is shown to be valid for internal, dynamical, quantized electromagnetic fields; its analogue in the case of external applied fields being well known. It is demonstrated that the transformation eliminates many of the difficulties associated with the false near fields and that it also allows certain radiative effects, where the atom acts as a whole, to be computed in a straight-forward manner.},

In an example we demonstrate the principle and analyze the sensitivity of the reconstruction process to experimental uncertainties as well as to finite grid limitations.

At very high energies the classical phase space is almost totally filled with irregular trajectories. The work reported in this Letter is similar to that performed by the authors on the HBnon-Heiles potential with the purpose of testing the prediction by Percival that there is good agreement between the amount of classical irregular motion and the proportion of energy eigenvalues sensitive to small changes in the perturbation parameter. However, the potential investigated in this Letter has several computational advantages over the HCnon-Heiles potential as well as avoiding complications due to quantum mechanical tunnelling. The results show good agreement with Percival’s predictions.},

This motion imprints a phase shift on the laser light, hence correlating the amplitude and phase noise, a consequence of which is optical squeezing. We experimentally demonstrate strong and continuous optomechanical squeezing of 1:7  0:2 dB below the shot-noise level. The peak level of squeezing measured near the mechanical resonance is well described by a model whose parameters are independently calibrated and that includes thermal motion of the membrane with no other classical noise sources},

The scope of this paper is wider than earlier ones in that the orientation of the plane of incidence is arbitrary. Certain interesting features are revealed. First, Snell's law is modified. Secondly, the resultant reflected and transmitted E and H vectors are not parallel (or antiparallel) to the incident E and H. Furthermore, when the incident wave is polarized with its electric field parallel to the plane of incidence, there is no angle of incidence (Brewster's angle) for which the reflected wave vanishes. An exception to these results occurs when the plane of incidence is parallel to the velocity. In this case, there is a strong resemblance to the nonmoving case.},

By using the mean-ﬁeld theory, we investigate the steady state solutions and analyze their dynamical stabilities. We ﬁnd that in the strong-interaction limit, the dynamics of the system is chaotic and exhibits random oscillations under appropriate laser detunings. The Lyapunov exponent criterion is introduced to conﬁrm the existence of this chaotic behavior. In addition, we present a full quantum calculation based on a six-atom model, and ﬁnd that the system exhibits some biantiferromagnetic properties in every triangular cell when the one-photon detuning is exactly resonant or blue shifted.},

The transport of atoms does not depend on the rate of change of the parameters (as along as the change is slow) and can distribute atoms in optical lattices at the quantized level without involving external forces. The transport of atoms depends on the atom filling in each double well and the interaction between atoms. In the strongly interacting region, the bosonic atoms share the same transport properties as noninteracting fermions with quantized transport at the half filling and no atom transport at the integer filling. In the weakly interacting region, the number of the transported atoms is proportional to the atom filling.We show the signature of the quantum transport from the momentum distribution of atoms that can be measured in the time-of-flight image. A semiclassical transport model is developed to explain the numerically observed transport of bosonic atoms in the noninteracting and strongly interacting limits. The scheme may serve as an quantized battery for atomtronics applications.},

By analogy to the canonical one-electron approximation of solid-state physics, we propose a onepolariton approximation to study these systems. Using this approximation, we apply Bloch states to the uniformly tuned Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model to analytically determine the energy-band structure. By analyzing the response of the band structure to local atom-cavity control, we explore its application as a quantum simulator and show phase-transition features absent in mean-field theory. Using this approach for solid light systems, we extend the analysis to include detuning impurities to show the solid light analogy of the semiconductor.

By directly transforming the internal geometry of the system, and locally tuning the permittivity between cavities, we provide an alternative framework suitable for tight-binding implementations of metamaterials.

  Abstract                 = {One of the fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics is associated with the Hermiticity of physical observables1. In the case of the Hamiltonian operator, this requirement not only implies real eigenenergies but also guarantees probability conservation. Interestingly, a wide class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can still show entirely real spectra. Among these are Hamiltonians respecting parity–time (PT) symmetry2–7. Even though the Hermiticity of quantum observableswas never in doubt, such concepts have motivated discussions on several fronts in physics, including quantum field theories8, non-Hermitian Anderson models9 and open quantum systems10,11, to mention a few. Although the impact of PT symmetry in these fields is still debated, it has been recently realized that optics can provide a fertile ground where PT-related notions can be implemented and experimentally investigated12–15. In this letter we report the first observation of the behaviour of a PT optical coupled system that judiciously involves a complex index potential. We observe both spontaneous PT symmetry breaking and power oscillations violating left–right symmetry. Our results may pave the way towards a new class of PT-synthetic materials with intriguing and unexpected properties that rely on non-reciprocal light propagation and tailored transverse energy flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we report the experimental observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a strongly interacting open photonic system. The system studied, comprising a Jaynes-Cummings dimer realized on a superconducting circuit platform, exhibits a dissipation-driven localization transition. Signatures of the transition in the homodyne signal and photon number reveal this transition to be from a regime of classical oscillations into a macroscopically self-trapped state manifesting revivals, a fundamentally quantum phenomenon. This experiment also demonstrates a small-scale realization of a new class of quantum simulator, whose well-controlled coherent and dissipative dynamics is suited to the study of quantum many-body phenomena out of equilibrium.}

The boson Josephson junction BJJ dynamics is described by the two-mode nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation that is solved analytically in terms of elliptic functions. The BJJ, being a neutral, isolated system, allows the investigations of dynamical regimes for the phase difference across the junction and for the population imbalance that are not accessible with superconductor Josephson junctions SJJâs. These include oscillations with either or both of the following properties: i the time-averaged value of the phase is equal to â² ( â² -phase oscillations; ii the average population imbalance is nonzero, in states with macroscopic quantum self-trapping. The nonsinusoidal generalization of the SJJ ac and plasma oscillations and the Shapiro resonance can also be observed. We predict the collapse of experimental data corresponding to different trap geometries and the total number of condensate atoms onto a single universal curve for the inverse period of oscillations. Analogies with Josephson oscillations between two weakly coupled reservoirs of 3 He-B and the internal Josephson effect in 3 He-A are also discussed.},

Moreover, by controlling the beam splitters, we are able to get an overlap between two images of the fibre and to directly observe an image describing the birefringence of the investigated fibre. This new arrangement has been applied to three polypropylene fibres and a graded-index FOS optical fibre in order to demonstrate its validity and powerful ability for monitoring the direct birefringence.

The fact that the eigenfunctions have zeros and poles in complex locations leads to an unconventional singularity structure of the quantum momentum function p(x), the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction, which forms the crux of the QHJ approach to quantization. A comparison of the singularity structure for these systems with the known exactly solvable and quasi-exactly solvable models reveals interesting differences. We find that the singularity structure of the momentum function for these new potentials lies between the above two distinct models, sharing similarities with both of them. This prompted us to examine the exactness of the supersymmetric WentzelâKramersâBrillouin (SWKB) quantization condition. The interesting singularity structure of p(x) and of the superpotential for these models has important consequences for the SWKB rule and in our proof of its exactness for these quantal systems.},

Adiabatic state preparation methods are used to prepare the ground states of the spin system. We employ two different multipartite quantum correlation measures to analyze the experimental ground state of the system in both the frustrated and the nonfrustrated regimes. As expected from theoretical predictions, the experimental data conﬁrm that the nonfrustrated regime shows higher multipartite quantum correlations compared to the frustrated one},

Resonances and bound states are obtained analytically. The transmitted flux shows a bistable behavior. Novel crossing scenarios of eigenstates similar to beak-to-beak structures are observed for a repulsive mean-field interaction. It is proven that resonances transform to bound states due to an attractive nonlinearity and vice versa for a repulsive nonlinearity, and the critical nonlinearity for the transformation is calculated analytically. The boundstate wave functions of the system satisfy an oscillation theorem as in the case of linear quantum mechanics.

Given specified constraints on the structural and dielectric parameters that delineate these stacks, the following key results come to the fore: the transmittance of the singly logarithmic stack shows single oscillatory maxima of almost full height at low frequencies and total quench at larger frequencies; the transmittance of the outbound doubly logarithmic stack shows twinned oscillatory maxima of full height at low frequencies, supplemented with a sharp, full resonance at a higher frequency against a background of suppressed transparency; the transmittance of the inbound doubly logarithmic stack shows twinned oscillatory maxima of full height at low frequencies, supplemented with a series of pairs of sharp spikes of full transparency for higher frequencies against a background of suppressed transparency. Thus, one-dimensional photonic structures generated by logarithmically similar dielectric constituents are capable of unfolding desirable and useful optical properties: transparency at low frequencies, but opacity, or selectivity, at higher frequencies, in one single photonic device.},

  Abstract                 = {Topological insulators are a new phase of matter1, with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces1, 2, 3. In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties11, 12, 14. Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect15, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field5. But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism—one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently6, 7, 8, 9, 10. One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states10. This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators16, 17, 18, 19, in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport—a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides20 arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schrödinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as ‘time’27. Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.},

The distinct properties of the resulting nanometre-scale building blocks can be harnessed in assemblies with new collective properties2,5,6, which can be further engineered by controlling interparticle spacing and by material processing. Our study is motivated by the emerging concept of metamaterials7âmaterials with properties arising from the controlled interaction of the different nanocrystals in an assembly. Previous multi-component nanocrystal assemblies have usually resulted in amorphous or shortrange- ordered materials8,9 because of non-directional forces or insufficient mobility during assembly10â14. Here we report the self-assembly of PbSe semiconductor quantum dots and Fe2O3 magnetic nanocrystals into precisely ordered three-dimensional superlattices. The use of specific size ratios directs the assembly of the magnetic and semiconducting nanoparticles into AB13 or AB2 superlattices with potentially tunable optical and magnetic properties.

A trapped gas of fermionic 40K atoms is evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy and then a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to control the atom-atom interactions. The location of this resonance is precisely determined from low-density measurements of molecule dissociation. In order to search for condensation on either side of the resonance, we introduce a technique that pairwise projects fermionic atoms onto molecules; this enables us to measure the momentum distribution of fermionic atom pairs. The transition to condensation of fermionic atom pairs is mapped out as a function of the initial atom gas temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature TF for magnetic-field detunings on both the BCS and BEC sides of the resonance.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of new artificial structures and materials is today one of the major research challenges in optics. In most studies so far, the design of such structures has been based on the judicious manipulation of their refractive index properties. Recently, the prospect of simultaneously using gain and loss was suggested as a new way of achieving optical behaviour that is at present unattainable with standard arrangements. What facilitated these quests is the recently developed notion of ‘parity–time symmetry’ in optical systems, which allows a controlled interplay between gain and loss. Here we report the experimental observation of light transport in large-scale temporal lattices that are parity–time symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate that periodic structures respecting this symmetry can act as unidirectional invisible media when operated near their exceptional points. Our experimental results represent a step in the application of concepts from parity–time symmetry to a new generation of multifunctional optical devices and networks.},

The intensities of the -1; 0 and -1; -1 diffraction beams were measured as functions of the angles of incidence for both s and p-polarization. The obtained radiation patterns can be explained using a simple ray interference model, but finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations are necessary to reproduce the observed dependence of the scattered radiation intensity on incident laser polarization.

Explicit expressions are found which describe the time evolution and directional character of the radiated power. Our approach applies to an arbitrary number of atoms which are confined to a region with linear dimensions which may be large compared with the mean wavelength of the emitted radiation. The radiative decay half-life of a large many-atom system is found to be much shorter than the natural lifetime of a single atom, but not as short as the half-life of a small atomic system with the same number of atoms. The far-field radiation pattern appropriate to the case of a circular cylinder of emitters which have been excited by a plane-wave pulse is considered in detail. Polar plots are presented of the radiation patterns produced when the atoms are excited by a plane-wave pulse. Excitingpulses traveling in directions both parallel and at an angle of 10' to the axis of the cylinder are considered. A discussion and generalization of Dtcke's "coherence-brightening" criterion is given.},

Monitoring the cavity output power, we observe constructive and destructive interference of collective Rayleigh scattering for certain relative distances between the two atoms. Because of cavity backaction onto the atoms, the cavity output power for the constructive two-atom case (N=2) is almost equal to the single-emitter case (N=1), which is in contrast to free-space where one would expect an N2 scaling of the power. These effects are quantitatively explained by a classical model as well as by a quantum mechanical model based on Dicke states. We extract information on the relative phases of the light fields at the atom positions and employ advanced cooling to reduce the jump rate between the constructive and destructive atom configurations. Thereby we improve the control over the system to a level where the implementation of two-atom entanglement schemes involving optical cavities becomes realistic.},

Electromagnetic shifts in free-electron mass and momentum, which can be of major importance in both kinematics and dynamics when the field is intense, and which are clearly in evidence in second-order radiation-gauge formulations, do not appear in the electric field gauge in any finite order of perturbation theory. Intense-field expressions like the closed-form Volkov solution, and mas and momentum intensity parameters, are shown to be invariant in form in simple gauges, but find no natural expression in the electric field gauge. It is also shown that intensisty effects introduce strongly spin-coupled terms even in non-relativistic problems. For both charged and neutral bound-state systems, crossed vector-potential terms occur in electric field gauge which prevent separation of the Schrodinger equation into center of mass and relative coordinate equations when the field intensity is high. This difficulty does not arise in the radiation gauge. These considerations inhibit the use of electric field gauge in intense-field problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore photon coincidence counting statistics in the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the atom-cavity coupling rate becomes comparable to the cavity resonance frequency. In this regime, usual normal order correlation functions fail to describe the output photon statistics. By expressing the electric-field operator in the cavity-emitter dressed basis, we are able to propose correlation functions that are valid for arbitrary degrees of light-matter interaction. Our results show that the standard photon blockade scenario is significantly modified for ultrastrong coupling. We observe parametric processes even for two-level emitters and temporal oscillations of intensity correlation functions at a frequency given by the ultrastrong photon emitter coupling. These effects can be traced back to the presence of two-photon cascade decays induced by counterrotating interaction terms.},

In this Letter, two different sequences of laser pulses implementing such a gate operation are analyzed using quantum process tomography. Fidelities of up to 92.6(6)% are achieved for single-gate operations and up to 83.4(8)% for two concatenated gate operations. By process tomography we assess the performance of the gates for different experimental realizations and demonstrate the advantage of amplitude-shaped laser pulses over simple square pulses. We also investigate whether the performance of concatenated gates can be inferred from the analysis of the single gates.},

This part is illustrated by a series of numerical simulations based on the theory of the Green dyadic.

  Abstract                 = {Anderson localization of waves in disordered media was originally predicted1 fifty years ago, in the context of transport of electrons in crystals2. The phenomenon is much more general3 and has been observed in a variety of systems, including light waves4,5. However, Anderson localization has not been observed directly for matter waves. Owing to the high degree of control over most of the system parameters (in particular the interaction strength), ultracold atoms offer opportunities for the study of disorder-induced localization6. Here we use a non-interacting BoseâEinstein condensate to study Anderson localization. The experiment is performed with a one-dimensional quasi-periodic latticeâa system that features a crossover between extended and exponentially localized states, as in the case of purely random disorder in higher dimensions. Localization is clearly demonstrated through investigations of the transport properties and spatial and momentum distributions. We characterize the crossover, finding that the critical disorder strength scales with the tunnelling energy of the atoms in the lattice. This controllable system may be used to investigate the interplay of disorder and interaction (ref. 7 and references therein), and to explore exotic quantum phases},

  Abstract                 = {We try to classify the spectrum of the two-qubit Dicke model by calculating two quantum information measures of its eigenstates: the Wootters concurrence and the mutual quantum information. We are able to detect four spectral sets in each parity subspace of the model: one set is regular and given by the product of a Fock state of the ﬁeld and the singlet Bell state of the qubits; the rest are fairly regular and related to the triplet states of the Bell basis. The singlet states become trapping states when we couple the Dicke model to an environment of harmonic oscillators, making them candidates for generating maximally entangled states in experimental realizations of ion trap quantum electrodynamics (QED) and circuit QED. Furthermore, they are robust and survive the inclusion of driving and dipole–dipole interactions, pointing to their use for storing quantum correlations, and it is straightforward to provide a generalization of these trapping states to the Dicke model with even number of qubits},

For didactic reasons, we split the analysis into classical propagation and quantum transport, but all methods can be implemented, mutatis mutandis, in a given case. On the classical side, we use coupled mode theory and present an operator approach to the Floquet–Bloch theory in order to study the propagation of a classical electromagnetic field in two particular infinite binary lattices. On the quantum side, we study the transport of photons in equivalent finite and infinite binary lattices by coupled mode theory and linear algebra methods involving orthogonal polynomials.

These parameter ranges have to be speciﬁed in for each particular case studied.

Under the rotating wave approximation, it is known as the Jaynes-Cummings model and without it as the Rabi model. Real-world realizations of the Jaynes-Cummings model include cavity, ion trap and circuit quantum electrodynamics. The Rabi model can be realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics. As soon as nonlinear couplings are introduced, feasible experimental realizations in quantum systems are drastically reduced. We propose a set of two photonic lattices that classically simulates the interaction of a single two-level system with a quantized field under field nonlinearities and nonlinear couplings as long as the quantum optics model conserves parity. We describe how to reconstruct the mean value of quantum optics measurements, such as photon number and atomic energy excitation, from the intensity and from the field, such as von Neumann entropy and fidelity, at the output of the photonic lattices. We discuss how typical initial states involving coherent or displaced Fock fields can be engineered from recently discussed Glauber-Fock lattices. As an example, the Buck-Sukumar model, where the coupling depends on the intensity of the field, is classically simulated for separable and entangled initial states.},

  Abstract                 = {We show a procedure to classically simulate the Majorana equation in 1+1 dimensions via two one-dimensional photonic crystals. We use a decomposition of the Majorana equation into two Dirac equations and propose an approach that uses a bichromatic refractive index distribution and nearest-neighbor couplings of the type found in Glauber-Fock lattices. This allows us to escape the restriction of staying near the Brillouin zone imposed by the classical simulation of Dirac dynamics with bichromatic lattices. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate the evolution of Gaussian wave packets under the Majorana-Dirac equation with light impinging only into the first waveguide of our bichromatic-Glauber-Fock lattice.},

The different field symmetries of the low- and high-frequency SLR bands lead to pronounced differences in their coupling to free-space radiation. Standing waves of very narrow spectral width compared to localized surface-plasmon resonances are formed at the highfrequency band edge, while subradiant damping onsets at the low-frequency band edge, leading the resonance into darkness. We introduce a coupled-oscillator analog to the plasmonic crystal, which serves to elucidate the physics of the coupled plasmonic resonances and which is used to estimate very high quality factors for SLRs.},

The time-dependent dynamics that leads to the target state is identified by means of optimal control theory (OCT) based on Krotov's method. Infidelities below 10−4 can be reached for the parameters of the experiment of Raimond, Haroche, Brune and co-workers, where the oscillator is a mode of a high-Q microwave cavity and the dipole is a Rydberg transition of an atom. For this specific situation we analyze the limitations on the fidelity due to parameter fluctuations and identify robust dynamics based on pulses found using ensemble OCT.

  Abstract                 = {We provide a general quantum theory to describe the coupling of light with the motion of a dielectric object inside a high-finesse optical cavity. In particular, we derive the total Hamiltonian of the system as well as a master equation describing the state of the center-of-mass mode of the dielectric and the cavity-field mode. In addition, a quantum theory of elasticity is used to study the coupling of the center-of-mass motion with internal vibrational excitations of the dielectric. This general theory is applied to the recent proposal of using an optically levitating nanodielectric as a cavity optomechanical system [see Romero-Isart et al., New J. Phys. 12, 033015 (2010); Chang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 1005 (2010)]. On this basis, we also design a light-mechanics interface to prepare non-Gaussian states of the mechanical motion, such as quantum superpositions of Fock states. Finally, we introduce a direct mechanical tomography scheme to probe these genuine quantum states by time-of- flight experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a time‐dependent variational method, we study the evolution of nonstationary states in Longuet‐Higgin’s model of a Jahn–Teller molecule. Conditions are found for the nuclear motion to be adiabatic. The effects of wave‐packet spreading are neglected upon specializing to the case of nearly harmonic motion. It is shown explicitly how the effective vector potential introduced by Mead and Truhlar gives rise to an electronic Berry phase. In a semiclassical approximation sufficient to produce the electronic adiabatic phase anticipated from the result for a given sequence of nuclear configurations, it is demonstrated that the effective vector potential has a negligible effect on the nuclear motion; the effective vector potential, the source of an effective field proportional to ℏ, is seen to affect the nuclear trajectory only in higher order. For the special case of periodic nuclear motion the electronic adiabatic phase is seen as a contribution to the geometric phase attending an arbitrary cyclic evolution. It is demonstrated that a molecular state prepared with identically pseudorotating nuclear wave packets in both electronic levels corresponds, in a weak coupling limit, to a spin 1/2 in a conically varying external field. Geometrical phase differences are shown to make discernible contributions to the frequencies of oscillation of the electronic charge and current densities, which may serve as classical sources for superradiant emission. Our results are shown to be gauge invariant.},

The fermionic Q-function obtained here is constructed using normally ordered Gaussian operators, which include both non-interacting thermal density matrices and BCS states. We prove that the Q-function exists for any density matrix, is real and positive, and has moments that correspond to Fermi operator moments. It is defined on a finite symmetric phase-space equivalent to the space of real, antisymmetric matrices. This has the natural SO(2M) symmetry expected for Majorana fermion operators. We show that there is a physical interpretation of the Q-function: it is the relative probability for observing a given Gaussian density matrix. The distribution has a uniform probability across the space at infinite temperature, while for pure states it has a maximum value on the phase-space boundary. The advantage of probabilistic representations is that they can be used for computational sampling without a sign problem.},

Two-photon correlation is much stronger in the waveguide for a driven three-level emitter (3LE) than a two-level emitter. The driven 3LE waveguide shows electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and we investigate the scaling of EIT for one and two photons. We show that the two transmitted photons are bunched together at any distance separation when energy of the incident photons meets ââtwo-photon resonanceââ criterion for EIT.},

Here, we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, that accelerating beams can be generated with a variety of arbitrarily chosen transverse shapes. We present a general method to construct such beams in the paraxial and nonparaxial regime and demonstrate experimentally their propagation in the paraxial case. The key ingredient of our method is the use of the spectral representation of the accelerating beams, which offers a unique and compact description of these beams. The on-demand accelerating light patterns described here are likely to give rise to new applications and add versatility to the current ones.},

We generalize the spin-ﬂip superoperator to a ‘‘universal inverter,’’ which acts on quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, and we introduce the corresponding generalized concurrence for joint pure states of D13D2 bipartite quantum systems. We call this generalized concurrence the I concurrence to emphasize its relation to the universal inverter. The universal inverter, which is a positive, but not completely positive superoperator, is closely related to the completely positive universal-NOT superoperator, the quantum analogue of a classical NOT gate.

  Abstract                 = {We provide a family of transparent tight-binding models with nontrivial potentials and site-dependent hopping parameters. Their feasibility is discussed in electromagnetic resonators, dielectric slabs, and quantum-mechanical traps. In the second part of the paper, the arrays are obtained through a generalization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in discrete variables. The formalism includes a finite-difference Darboux transformation applied to the scattering matrix of a periodic array. A procedure for constructing a hierarchy of discrete Hamiltonians is indicated and a particular biparametric family is given. The corresponding potentials and hopping functions are identified as solitary waves, pointing to a discrete spinorial generalization of the Korteweg-deVries family.},

It is shown that in an unbounded âchiral mediumâ (twisted media) the degeneration existing between particles of different helicities is removed. For ultrarelativistic particles, an analog to the inverse optical Magnus effect follows where the effect is determined by the chirality of the medium. From the inverse scattering problem for the transforms under consideration it follows that the amplitude of the wave function of a particle in a chiral medium can vary with time according to a linear law (for example, the process of neutrino (antineutrino) production or annihilation), and the parameters of the medium satisfy the evolution equation.},

  Abstract                 = {Controlling the interaction between localized optical and mechanical excitations has recently become possible following advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques1,2. So far, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system1,3. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency4 (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting5. In atomic systems, studies6,7 of slow and stopped light (applicable to modern optical networks8 and future quantum networks9) have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the past two decades. Here we demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal, using the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light by way of engineered photonâphonon interactions. Our device is fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon. At low temperature (8.7 kelvin), we report an optically tunable delay of 50 nanoseconds with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microsecond signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantumoptomechanicalmemory10, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature in the analogous regime of electromagnetically induced absorption show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring a mechanical object’s motion, even with the gentle touch of light, fundamentally alters its dynamics. The experimental manifestation of this basic principle of quantum mechanics, its link to the quantum nature of light and the extension of quantum measurement to the macroscopic realm have all received extensive attention over the past half-century1, 2. The use of squeezed light, with quantum fluctuations below that of the vacuum field, was proposed nearly three decades ago3 as a means of reducing the optical read-out noise in precision force measurements. Conversely, it has also been proposed that a continuous measurement of a mirror’s position with light may itself give rise to squeezed light4, 5. Such squeezed-light generation has recently been demonstrated in a system of ultracold gas-phase atoms6 whose centre-of-mass motion is analogous to the motion of a mirror. Here we describe the continuous position measurement of a solid-state, optomechanical system fabricated from a silicon microchip and comprising a micromechanical resonator coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. Laser light sent into the cavity is used to measure the fluctuations in the position of the mechanical resonator at a measurement rate comparable to its resonance frequency and greater than its thermal decoherence rate. Despite the mechanical resonator’s highly excited thermal state (104 phonons), we observe, through homodyne detection, squeezing of the reflected light’s fluctuation spectrum at a level 4.5 ± 0.2 per cent below that of vacuum noise over a bandwidth of a few megahertz around the mechanical resonance frequency of 28 megahertz. With further device improvements, on-chip squeezing at significant levels should be possible, making such integrated microscale devices well suited for precision metrology applications.},

For a relatively dense condensate, one-dimensional coupled equations with the nonpolynomial nonlinearity of both repulsive and attractive signs are derived from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Profiles of modes confined in an external potential under the action of the self-repulsion, and self-trapped solitons in the case of the self-attraction, are found in a numerical form and by means of analytical approximations. In the former case, the interplay of the SO and Rabi couplings with the repulsive nonlinearity strongly distorts shapes of the trapped modes, adding conspicuous sidelobes to them. In the case of the attractive nonlinearity, the most essential result is reduction of the collapse threshold under the action of the SO and Rabi couplings.}

The ratchet transport arises from broken spatiotemporal symmetries of the driven potential, resulting in a desymmetrization of transporting eigenstates (Floquet states). The full quantum character of the ratchet transport was demonstrated by the measured atomic current oscillating around a nonzero stationary value at longer observation times, resonances occurring at positions determined by the photon recoil, and dependence of the transport current on the initial phase of the driving potential.},

  Abstract                 = {Spontaneous emission by an excited fermionic atom can be suppressed due to the Pauli exclusion principle if the relevant final states after the decay are already occupied by identical atoms in the ground state. Here we discuss a setup where a single atom is prepared in the first excited state on a single site of an optical lattice under conditions of very tight trapping.We investigate these phenomena in the context of two experimental realizations: (1)with alkali-metal atoms,where the decay rate of the excited state is large, and (2)with alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms, where the decay rate from metastable states can be tuned in experiments. This phenomenon has potential applications towards reservoir engineering and dissipative many-body state preparation in an optical lattice.},

  Abstract                 = {A major goal in optomechanics is to observe and control quantum behaviour in a system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to an optical cavity. Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom. However, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enable us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic or quartic in the membrane’s displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane’s displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ. In particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane’s mechanical energy.},

Away from criticality, revival times exhibit smooth, nonsingular behavior and are proportional to the system size. Upon approaching a quantum critical point, they diverge as a power law and scale with the system size, although the scaling is no longer linear.},

Previous experiments in this area3-6 have been restricted to an approach7 that followed the original EPR argument in considering only two different measurement settings per side. Here we demonstrate experimentally that EPR-steering occurs for mixed entangled states that are Bell local (that is, that cannot possibly demonstrate Bell non-locality). Unlike the case of Bell inequalities8-11 , increasing the number of measurement settings beyond two-we use up to six-significantly increases the robustness of the EPR-steering phenomenon to noise.},

This can be achieved if the two qubits are biased simultaneously by this weak signal and a strong pump signal, both having frequencies close to the interlevel transitions in the system. The weak signal strongly affects the spectrum generated by the strong pumping drive by producing and controlling mixed harmonics with amplitudes of the order of the main harmonic of the strong drive. We show that the amplification is robust with respect to noise, with an intensity of the order of the weak signal. When deviating from the optimal regime (corresponding to strong qubit coupling and a weak signal frequency equal to the interlevel transition frequency), the proposed amplifier becomes less efficient, but it can still considerably enhance a weak signal (by several tens). We therefore propose to use coupled qubits as a combined parametric amplifier and frequency shifter.},

Applied to QED in varying dielectrics, the response theory approach facilitates the study of two distinct processes contributing to the production of photons: the squeezing effect due to space-time varying properties of the medium and the velocity effect due to its motion. An alternative quantization method of the electromagnetic field in linear, inhomogeneous but nondispersive dynamical dielectrics is proposed. The generalization of this approach to finite temperatures as well as the relation to sonoluminescence is indicated.},

Consequently, the individual particles may not be considered as independent sources of radiation. In this regard, the question arises of whether quantum dot (QD) systems may also exhibit signatures of cooperative radiation and hence have to be considered as coupled quantum systems. Here, we present experimental evidence for a long-range electromagnetic interaction between laterally arranged QDs. The experimental results suggest that the QDs do not behave like independent objects as long as they form an ensemble of QDs. By removing QDs from the sample, we found that the coupling was reduced. The range of interaction is shown to be at least 150 nm. This may therefore provide a mechanism to couple discrete quantum objects on a large scale.},

While sharing important properties with other systems of interacting quantum particles, here we argue that the nature of light-matter interaction gives rise to unique features with no analogs in condensed matter or atomic physics setups. By discussing the physics of a lattice model of delocalized photons coupled locally with two-level systems through the elementary light-matter interaction described by the Rabi model, we argue that the inclusion of counterrotating terms, so far neglected, is crucial to stabilize finite-density quantum phases of correlated photons out of the vacuum, with no need for an artificially engineered chemical potential. We show that the competition between photon delocalization and Rabi nonlinearity drives the system across a novel Z2 parity symmetry-breaking quantum criticality between two gapped phases that share similarities with the Dicke transition of quantum optics and the Ising critical point of quantum magnetism. We discuss the phase diagram as well as the low-energy excitation spectrum and present analytic estimates for critical quantities.},

Most of these applications involve light-matter interactions, hence their propagation range is limited by absorption. We propose loss-proof accelerating beams that overcome linear and nonlinear losses. These beams, as analytic solutions of Maxwell’s equations with losses, propagate in absorbing media while maintaining their peak intensity. While the power such beams carry decays during propagation, the peak intensity and the structure of their main lobe region are maintained over large distances. We use these beams for manipulation of particles in fluids, steering the particles to steeper angles than ever demonstrated. Such beams offer many additional applications, such as loss-proof self-bending plasmons. In transparent media these beams show exponential intensity growth, which facilitates other novel applications in micromanipulation and ignition of nonlinear processes.}

We transform the s-d Hamiltonian such that the renormalization can be started with a finite relaxation time. The transformed Hamiltonian consists of a resonance level (the Tolouse limit) and a large perturbation. The resonance width acts like an infrared cutoff such that perturbation expansion at T=0 converges term by term.

In the strongly correlated regime the phase diagram and the elementary excitations of lattice polaritons near the Mott lobes are calculated analytically using a slave-boson theory (SBT). The opposite regime of weakly interacting polariton superfluids is described by a weak-coupling mean-field theory for a generalized multi-mode Dicke model. We show that a remarkable relation between the two theories exists in the limit of large photon bandwidth and large negative detuning, i.e., when the nature of polariton quasiparticles becomes qubit-like. In this regime, the weak-coupling theory predicts the existence of a single Mott lobe with a change of the universality class of the phase transition at the tip of the lobe, in perfect agreement with the SBT. Moreover, the spectra of low energy excitations, i.e., the sound velocity of the Goldstone mode and the gap of the amplitude mode match exactly as calculated from both theories.},

  Abstract                 = {The Jaynes-Cummings model describes the coupling between photons and a single two-level atom in a simplified representation of light-matter interactions. In circuit QED, this model is implemented by combining microwave resonators and superconducting qubits on a microchip with unprecedented experimental control. Arranging qubits and resonators in the form of a lattice realizes a new kind of Hubbard model, the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, in which the elementary excitations are polariton quasiparticles. Due to the genuine openness of photonic systems, circuit QED lattices offer the possibility to study the intricate interplay of collective behavior, strong correlations and non-equilibrium physics. Thus, turning circuit QED into an architecture for quantum simulation, i.e., using a wellcontrolled system to mimic the intricate quantum behavior of another system too daunting for a theorist to tackle head-on, is an exciting idea which has served as theorists’ playground for a while and is now also starting to catch on in experiments. This review gives a summary of the most recent theoretical proposals and experimental efforts.},

The effective (pseudo)spin interactions making up such quantum simulators are found to be proportional to the dipoleâdipole interaction between the trapped ions, and are mediated by motion that can be driven by state-dependent forces. The precise forms of the trapping potentials and the interactions are derived in the presence of an SE and a cover electrode. These results are the starting point to derive an optimized SE geometry for trapping ions in the desired honeycomb lattice of Kitaevâs model, where we design the dipoleâdipole interactions in a way that allows for coupling all three bond types of the model simultaneously, without the need for time discretization. Finally, we propose a simple wire structure that can be incorporated into a microfabricated chip to generate localized state-dependent forces which drive the couplings prescribed by this particular model; such a wire structure should be adaptable to many other situations.},

The dynamics of the maximum, located at the mean value of position, is governed by the Newtonian equation of the corresponding classical problem. The width, which is directly proportional to the position uncertainty, obeys a complex nonlinear Riccati equation which can be transformed into a real nonlinear Ermakov equation. The coupled pair of these equations yields a dynamical invariant which plays a key role in our investigation. It can be expressed in terms of a complex variable that linearizes the Riccati equation. This variable also provides the time-dependent parameters that characterize the Green's function, or Feynman kernel, of the corresponding problem. From there, also the relation between the classical and quantum dynamics of the systems can be obtained. Furthermore, the close connection between the Ermakov invariant and the Wigner function will be shown. Factorization of the dynamical invariant allows for comparison with creation/annihilation operators and supersymmetry where the partner potentials fulfil (real) Riccati equations. This provides the link to a nonlinear formulation of time-independent quantum mechanics in terms of an Ermakov equation for the amplitude of the stationary state wave functions combined with a conservation law. Comparison with SUSY and the time-dependent problems concludes our analysis.},

As the angular acceleration takes place in a bounded space, the azimuthal degree of freedom, such fields accelerate periodically as they propagate. Notably, the amount of angular acceleration is not limited by paraxial considerations, may be tailored for large accelerations over arbitrarily long distances, and can be engineered independently of the beam's spatial extent.

  Abstract                 = {Electromagnetic signals are always composed of photons, although in the circuit domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the discreteness of the photon’s energy is usually not evident. However, by coupling a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) to signals on a microwave transmission line, it is possible to construct an integrated circuit in which the presence or absence of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. Such a system1 can be described by circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)—the circuit equivalent of cavity QED, where photons interact with atoms or quantum dots. Previously, circuit QED devices were shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit could absorb and re-emit a single photon many times2. Here we report a circuit QED experiment in the strong dispersive limit, a new regime where a single photon has a large effect on the qubit without ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the qubit transition energy can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of the probability of finding the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This effect is used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields, and could be used to create a photon statistics analyser. As no photons are absorbed by this process, it should be possible to generate non-classical states of light by measurement and perform qubit–photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most interesting phenomena in solid-state physics is Anderson localization, which predicts that an electron may become immobile when placed in a disordered lattice1. The origin of localization is interference between multiple scatterings of the electron by random defects in the potential, altering the eigenmodes from being extended (Bloch waves) to exponentially localized2. As a result, the material is transformed from a conductor to an insulator. Andersonâs work dates back to 1958, yet strong localization has never been observed in atomic crystals, because localization occurs only if the potential (the periodic lattice and the fluctuations superimposed on it) is time-independent. However, in atomic crystals important deviations from the Anderson model always occur, because of thermally excited phonons and electronâelectron interactions. Realizing that Anderson localization is a wave phenomenon relying on interference, these concepts were extended to optics3,4. Indeed, both weak5â7,31 and strong8â11 localization effects were experimentally demonstrated, traditionally by studying the transmission properties of randomly distributed optical scatterers (typically suspensions or powders of dielectric materials). However, in these studies the potential was fully random, rather than being âfrozenâ fluctuations on a periodic potential, as the Anderson model assumes. Here we report the experimental observation of Anderson localization in a perturbed periodic potential: the transverse localization of light caused by random fluctuations on a two-dimensional photonic lattice. We demonstrate how ballistic transport becomes diffusive in the presence of disorder, and that crossover to Anderson localization occurs at a higher level of disorder. Finally, we study how nonlinearities affect Anderson localization. As Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon, the ideas presented here could also be implemented in other systems (for example, matter waves), thereby making it feasible to explore experimentally long-sought fundamental concepts, and bringing up a variety of intriguing questions related to the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity.},

We focus speciﬁcally on the strong-coupling regime where the cavity decays much faster than the mechanical modes, and the optomechanical coupling is comparable to or larger than the mechanical frequency, so that both the optical and mechanical systems operate in the deep quantum regime. Using the examples of one and two mechanical oscillators, we show that the system can classically exhibit bistability and bifurcations, and we explore how these manifest themselves in interference, entanglement, and correlation in the quantum theory, while revealing the impact of decoherence of the mechanical system due to cavity ﬂuctuations and coherent driving.}

The usual mean-field approach is the classical limit, and the inverse number of atoms plays the role of Planck constant. The ground state of positive-mass particles corresponds to the mean-field fixed point of lower energy, while that of negative mass to the excited fixed point. In the case of attractive BECs above the threshold for symmetry breaking, the ground state is the Schr{\"o}dinger cat state and we relate this to the double-well shape of the potential in Fock space. In the repulsive case, we identify the quantum states corresponding to the meanphase macroscopic quantum field macroscopic self-trapping phenomenon. In particular, the phase-locked self-trapping of BECs is related to the double-well shape of the potential in Fock space. The running-phase macroscopic quantum self-trapping state is found to be subject to quantum collapses and revivals. The phase dispersion grows exponentially, reaching the absolute maximum just before the first collapse of the running phase, which may explain the growth of the phase fluctuations seen in the experiment on macroscopic quantum self-trapping.},

For the energy-level spectrum, we concentrate on studying the degeneracy in low-energy levels. For the ground state, we focus on its nonclassical properties that are necessary for preparing the nonclassical states. We show that the minimum qubit-oscillator coupling strength needed for generating the nonclassical states of the Schrodinger-cat type in the oscillator is just one half of that in the Rabi model. We ﬁnd that the qubit-qubit entanglement in the ground state vanishes if the qubit-oscillator coupling strength is strong enough, for which the entropy of three qubits remains larger than 1.

This is because the plane polarized wave gives a broad central lobe caused mainly by a parasitic longitudinal field component. It is known that this problem can be overcome by focusing radially polarized light. Here we demonstrate that other polarization distributions based on a linear combination of transverse electric (TE1) and transverse magnetic (TM1) fields can give a beam even narrower than for the radially polarized case. Special cases of this combination are identified, corresponding to the smallest width (TE1), and the maximum peak intensity compared with the side lobes (electric dipole polarization). Axially-symmetric forms can be generated by illumination with elliptically polarized light. A particular case is azimuthal polarization with a phase singularity, which is equivalent to TE1. For a semi-angular aperture of 60Â°, the TE1 case gives a central lobe width 9% narrower than for radially polarized illumination, while for plane polarized illumination it is 12% wider than the radially polarized case.},

The advantage of this approach is that it gives the intensity at all points in space. This is of particular value when the cross-section of the annulus is narrow compared with its radius, because then the intensity varies slowly along the optic axis. Intensity is plotted for the region near the focus, far from the focus, along the optic axis, and on the geometrical cone of illumination. Contours of equal intensity in the focal region are also plotted. The possibility of constructing low-loss resonators with annular mirrors is also discussed},

  Abstract                 = {The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems1, 2 in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes3.},

Airy tails act as low intensity “dressing” pulses, refuel the Airy main lobe, and modify propagation dynamics of Airy pulses. It is demonstrated that a soliton sheds from the main lobe of Airy pulses and the spectrum maximum intensity is periodically manifested due to the effect of self-phase modulation. The intrinsically asymmetric nature of Airy pulses is revealed through the nonlinear generation of a Raman soliton self-frequency shift and the generation of static solitons driven by the soliton fission processes and the interactions with dressing Airy tails. The resulting Raman-induced frequency shift can be controlled by using time-reversed Airy pulses and varying truncation coefficients. Numerical results show that the frequency shift can be enhanced with a larger input peak power as well.}

We discuss the dependence of this enhancement on the properties of a specific environment at hand, the form of the coupling term, and the coupling strength. Given a certain type of coupling to the environment, we find the characteristic dephasing time corresponding to the crossover from weak to strong dephasing. We argue that this crossover can be regarded as a probe of the relevant time scale of phase oscillations, which are suppressed by the specific dephasing mechanism},

For fields having a statistical distributions of photon numbers the oscillations collapse to an expected steady value . In 1980 it was discovered that with appropriate initial conditions (e .g . a near-classical field), the Rabi oscillations would eventually revive, only to collapse and revive repeatedly in a complicated pattern . The existence of these revivals, present in the analytic solutions of the JCM, provided direct evidence for discreteness of field excitation (photons) and hence for the truly quantum nature of radiation . Subsequent study revealed further non-classical properties of the JCM field, such as a tendency of the photons to antibunch . Within the last two years it has been found that during the quiescent intervals of collapsed Rabi oscillations the atom and field exist in a macroscopic superposition state (a Schrodinger cat) . This discovery offers the opportunity to use the JCM to elucidate the basic properties of quantum correlation (entanglement) and to explore still further the relationship between classical and quantum physics . The relative simplicity of the JCM and the ease with which it can be extended through analytic expressions or numerical computation . continues to motivate attention, as evidenced by the growing abundance of publications . We here present an overview of the theory of the JCM and some of the many extensions and generalizations that have appeared .},

A single-exciton band is considered in the tight-binding model; the exciton is coupled to Einstein phonons through a short-range linear interaction. We first verify that a variational wave function corresponding to simple displacements of the lattice coordinates (analogous to the Lee - Low-Pines wave function for the polaron) leads to an unphysical result: For strong exciton-phonon coupling the effective mass of the excitons depends discontinuously on the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We obtain an improved trial function by studying an exactly soluble problem: an exciton hopping between two sites and coupled to a phonon field. The new trial function allows distortion of the Gaussian form of the phonon wave function as well as displacement. Analogous trial functions are used to calculate the energy and effective mass for a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor exciton hopping. The results are a continuous effective mass and a substantial improvement of the ground-state energy over the Lee- - Low Pines trial function. Arguments are given that the qualitative behavior of the ground state is independent of the dimensionality of the lattice, so that the one-dimensional calculation performed here is adequate.},

Here, we present the first experimental observations of bright polariton solitons in a strongly coupled semiconductor microcavity. The polariton solitons are shown to be micrometre-scale localized non-diffracting wave packets with a corresponding broad spectrum in momentum space. Unlike the solitons known in Bose condensed atomic gases, they are non-equilibrium and rely on a balance between losses and external pumping. Microcavity polariton solitons are excited on picosecond timescales, and thus have further benefits for information processing over light-only solitons in semiconductor cavity lasers, which have nanosecond response times.},

Superconducting qubits made with scalable microfabrication techniques are a promising candidate for the realization of a large-scale quantum information processor5â 9. Although these systems have successfully passed tests of coherent coupling for up to four qubits10â13, communication of individual quantum states between superconducting qubits via a quantum bus has not yet been realized. Here, we perform an experiment demonstrating the ability to coherently transfer quantum states between two superconducting Josephson phase qubits through a quantum bus. This quantum bus is a resonant cavity formed by an open-ended superconducting transmission line of length 7 mm. After preparing an initial quantum state with the first qubit, this quantum information is transferred and stored as a nonclassical photon state of the resonant cavity, then retrieved later by the second qubit connected to the opposite end of the cavity. Beyond simple state transfer, these results suggest that a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity could also function as a useful short-term memory element. The basic architecture presented here can be expanded, offering the possibility for the coherent interaction of a large number of superconducting qubits.},

  Abstract                 = {We study square and triangular optical lattice formation using a diffraction technique with light-possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM). We demonstrate that it is possible to use Fraunhofer diffraction of light by a square aperture to unveil OAM about two times bigger than would be possible with a triangular aperture. We notice that the pattern remains truncated until a topological charge (TC) equal to 20 with good precision. Even though a square pattern cannot be used to determine the TC sign, it is possible to measure high order of the modulus and sign of the TC up to 20, combining patterns of the triangular and square apertures.},

For general atomic distances, we consider a subset of initial states analytically, and then treat the more general situation numerically. We examine a variety of qualitative features such as entanglement sudden death, dynamical generation, protection and transfer between subsystems. Our analysis shows a stark contrast in features of entanglement between the two special coupling schemes often considered; further, these features are uncharacteristic of those arising for general distances, due to the high degree of symmetry present in the special cases. The variety of behaviours in these two-mode cases suggests the importance of considering atomic separation carefully for any model where two atoms interact with a common field.},

As a measure for the correlations in the initial state we consider the trace distance between the system-environment state and the product of its marginal states. In particular, we examine the correlations contained in the thermal equilibrium state for the total system, analyze their dependence on the temperature and on the coupling strength, and demonstrate their connection to the entanglement properties of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. A detailed study of the time dependence of the distinguishability of the open system states evolving from the thermal equilibrium state and its corresponding uncorrelated product state shows that the open system dynamically uncovers typical features of the initial correlations.},

According to the Heisenberg principle, this is accompanied by a huge uncertainty in their relative phase. By overlapping bright twin beams on a beam splitter, we convert phase fluctuations into photon-number fluctuations and observe this uncertainty as a typical 'U-shape' of the output photon-number distribution. This effect, although reported for atomic ensembles and giving hope for phase super-resolution, has never been observed for light beams. The shape of the normalized photon-number difference distribution is similar to the one that would be observed for high-order Fock states. It can be also mimicked by classical beams with artificially mixed phase, but without any perspective for phase super-resolution. The probability distribution at the beam splitter output can be used for filtering macroscopic superpositions at the input.},

  Abstract                 = {A single-atom quantum memory The faithful storage of a quantum bit (qubit) of light is essential for long-distance quantum communication, quantum networking and distributed quantum computing1. The required optical quantum memory must be able to receive and recreate the photonic qubit; additionally, it must store an unknown quantum state of light better than any classical device. So far, these two requirements have been met only by ensembles of material particles that store the information in collective excitations2-7. Recent developments, however, have paved the way for an approach in which the information exchange occurs between single quanta of light and matter8-13. This single-particle approach allows the material qubit to be addressed, which has fundamental advantages for realistic implementations. First, it enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage of a photon by means of state detection14-16; this can be used to combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies. Second, it allows for individual qubit manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ processing of the stored quantum information. Here we demonstrate the most fundamental implementation of such a quantum memory, by mapping arbitrary polarization states of light into and out of a single atom trapped inside an optical cavity. The memory performance is tested with weak coherent pulses and analysed using full quantum process tomography. The average fidelity is measured to be 93%, and low decoherence rates result in qubit coherence times exceeding 180 microseconds. This makes our system a versatile quantum node with excellent prospects for applications in optical quantum gates17 and quantum repeaters},

It is found that the model system can successfully simulate most features of entanglement, but fails to simulate quantum nonlocality. Investigations of how far the classical simulation can be pushed show that quantum nonlocality is the essential ingredient of a quantum computer, even more so than entanglement. The wellknown problem of exponential resources required for a classical simulation of a quantum computer, is also linked to the nonlocal nature of entanglement, rather than to the nonfactorizability of the state vector.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article we use the method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to design a photonic lattice (array of waveguides) which can drive the input light to a controlled location at the output. The output position in the array is determined by functions of the propagation distance along the waveguides, which modulate the lattice characteristics (index of refraction, and first- and second-neighbor couplings). The proposed coupler is expected to possess the robustness properties of the design method, coming from its adiabatic nature, and also to have a smaller footprint than purely adiabatic couplers. The present work provides a very interesting example where methods from quantum control can be exploited to design lattices with desired input-output properties.},

The proposed approximate functional is based on finite-temperature density-functional theory and yields the exact Kohn-Sham potential at the particle-hole symmetric point. Furthermore, in the limit of zero temperature it correctly exhibits a derivative discontinuity which is shown to be essential to reproduce the conductance plateau. On the other hand, at the Kondo temperature the exact Kohn-Sham conductance overestimates the real one by an order of magnitude. To understand the failure of density-functional theory, we resort to its timedependent version and conclude that the suppression of the Kondo resonance must be attributed to dynamical exchange-correlation corrections.},

At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates4 , the creation of complex entangled states5,6 and the demonstration of algorithms7 or error correction8 . Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers9 , dispersive quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has enabled continuous10 and discrete11 feedback control of single qubits. Here we realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture12–14. We use a set of two parametric amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout, combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 104 s 21 , exceeding other reported implementations. The low transmission loss of superconducting waveguidesis likely to enable the range of this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application in error correction schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the basic theory of the mechanical action of light in resonant interaction with atoms. At present the main application is laser cooling, but the approach is applicable to a broader range of phenomena. It is based on an adiabatic eliminination philosophy, which turns out to give the lowest-order quantum corrections to the behavior found when the photon momentum goes to zero. hence it is called a semiclassical theory. In this manner a subjective but consistent approach can be presented; other treatments are incorporated or mentioned at the appropriate places. Both the classical and the quantum-mechanical approach are discussed. Those readers who wish to obtain only a heuristic overview of the phenomena can concentrate on Sec. III, which treats both the photon momentum effects and their connection with photon counting statistics. The detailed theoretical treatment utilizes Wigner functions and Fokker-Planck techniques. The ensuing theory is applied both to the cooling of free particles and trapped ones. The paper ends with an extensive bibliography, where the author lists most papers of interest for research into the mechanical manifestations of light. For completeness, many papers are included that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.},

In the classical limit, this system has two distinct integrable regimes, α=0 and α=π/2. For each integrable regime we can express the quantum Hamiltonian as a function of two action operators. Their eigenvalues (multiples of ℏ) are the natural quantum numbers for the complete level spectrum. This functional dependence cannot be extended into the nonintegrable regime (0<α<π/2). Here level crossings are prohibited and the level spectrum is naturally described by a single (energy sorting) quantum number. In consequence, the tracking of individual eigenstates along closed paths through both regimes leads to conflicting assignments of quantum numbers. This effect is a useful and reliable indicator of quantum chaos—a diagnostic tool that is independent of any level-statistical analysis.},

We show that in a supersolid the net vacancy density remains constant as function of temperature, contrary to the thermal activation theory. We also analyzed in detail the thermodynamic properties of a supersolid, calculated the jump in the specific heat which compares well to the recent experiments.},

The maximum power-transfer efficiency can be obtained when the spacings of the propagation constants are all equal. By adjusting the widths or indexes of the guides and the separations between the guides, we can achieve this requirement. Such a task can be performed automatically by solving nonlinear simultaneous equations using the Newton-Raphson method. By means of this method, we are able to obtain the maximum power transfer from one outermost guide to the other outermost guide for an arbitrary number of guides of a multiple-waveguide coupler at any reasonable frequencies}

  Abstract                 = {We investigate a Landau-Zener (LZ) transition process modeled by a quantum two-level system (TLS) coupled to a photon mode when the bias energy is varied linearly in time. The initial state of the photon field is assumed to be a superposition of coherent states, leading to a more intricate LZ transition. Applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), analytical results are obtained revealing the enhancement of the LZ probability by increasing the average photon number. We also consider the creation of entanglement and the change of photon statistics during the LZ process. Without the RWA, we find some qualitative differences of the LZ dynamics from the RWA results; e.g., the average photon number no longer monotonically enhances the LZ probability. The ramifications and implications of these results are explored.},

The approach is applied to generation of isospectral potentials with additional or removal bound states or construction of new partner potentials without changing the spectrum, i.e. fully isospectral potentials.

Furthermore, if the secular problem is of nth order, then the continued fraction f(X') may be developed in n different ways. Since the eigenvalues are roots of a function f(X), it is convenient to find the eigenvalues by means of the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. This requires that the derivative of f(X) with respect to X(f'(XÂ» be determined. An exact expression for 1'(X) is derived and it is shown that f'(X') is in fact the norm of the eigenvector belonging to the eigenvalue X'. A simple recursion formula, in continued fraction form, for the eigenvector elements is also derived. The Newton-Raphson procedure is further shown to be equivalent to the variational method for iterative calculation of eigenvalues. The former procedure has, however, the advantage of bypassing the necessity of solving a set of simultaneous equations. Advantage is taken of the relation between f' (X') and the eigenvector of A'to formulate a reasonable criterion for choosing the best possible development of f(x) is order to avoid convergence to an undesired root of f(X)},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic localization is the suppression of the broadening of a charged-particle wave packet as it moves along a periodic potential in an a.c. electric field1, 2, 3. The same effect occurs for optical beams in curved photonic lattices, where the lattice bending has the role of the driving field, and leads to the cancellation of diffraction4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Dynamic localization was also observed for Bose–Einstein condensates9, and could have a role in the spin dynamics of molecular magnets10. It has been predicated that dynamic localization will occur in multi-dimensional lattices at a series of resonances between lattice, particle and driving-field parameters1. However, only the first dynamic localization resonance in one-dimensional lattices has been observed in any physical system6, 7, 8, 9. Here, we report on the experimental observation of higher-order and mixed dynamic localization resonances in both one- and two-dimensional photonic lattices. New features such as spectral broadening of the dynamic localization resonances and localization-induced transformation of the lattice symmetry are demonstrated. These phenomena could be used to shape polychromatic beams emitted by supercontinuum light sources11, 12.}

Photons are an optimal choice for carrying information in the form of ‘flying qubits’, but the teleportation of photonic quantum bits6–11 (qubits) has been limited by experimental inefficiencies and restrictions. Main disadvantages include the fundamentally probabilistic nature of linearoptics Bell measurements12, as well as the need either to destroy the teleported qubit or attenuate the input qubit when the detectors do not resolve photon numbers13. Here we experimentally realize fully deterministic quantum teleportation of photonic qubitswithout postselection. The key step is to make use of a hybrid technique involving continuous-variable teleportation14–16of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit. When the receiver’s feedforward gain is optimally tu ned, the continuous-variable teleporter acts as a pure loss channel17,18 , and theinput dual-rail-encoded qubit, based on a single photon, represents a quantum error detection code against photon loss19 and hence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for a faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable entangled states: for four qubits the overall transfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 and all of them exceed the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a relatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more efficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into account only the qubit subspaces), and with a fidelity comparable to the previously reported values.},

For small atom-cavity detuning, the âsuperfluidâ becomes more and more obvious with the increase of the dipole-dipole interaction. In addition, the strong dipole-dipole interaction can lead the atomic excitation to be suppressed completely, and only the photonic excitation exists for the ground states.When the atom-cavity detuning is comparable with the dipole-dipole interaction, the dipole-dipole interaction enlarges the positive detunings, which is in favor of exhibiting superfluid photonic states. While for the negative detuning, the dipole-dipole interaction will reduce it, and contribute to the formation of the polaritonic insulator states. The cases for extended models have also been briefly analyzed.We also discuss how to find these novel phenomena in future experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical micromanipulation stands for contact-free handling of microscopic particles by light. Optical forces can manipulate non-absorbing objects in a large range of sizes, e.g., from biological cells down to cold atoms. Recently much progress has been made going from the micro- down to the nanoscale. Less attention has been paid to going the other way, trapping increasingly large particles. Optical tweezers typically employ a single laser beam tightly focused by a microscope objective of high numerical aperture to stably trap a particle in three dimensions (3D). As the particle size increases, stable 3D trapping in a single-beam trap requires scaling up the optical power, which eventually induces adverse biological effects. Moreover, the restricted field of view of standard optical tweezers, dictated by the use of high NA objectives, is particularly unfavorable for catching actively moving specimens. Both problems can be overcome by traps with counter-propagating beams. Our âmacro-tweezersâ are especially designed to trap highly motile organisms, as they enable three-dimensional all-optical trapping and guiding in a volume of 2 Ã 1 Ã2 mm3. Here we report for the first time the optical trapping of large actively swimming organisms, such as for instance Euglena protists and dinoflagellates of up to 70 $\mu$m length. Adverse bio-effects are kept low since trapping occurs outside high intensity regions, e.g., focal spots. We expect our approach to open various possibilities in the contact-free handling of 50â100 $\mu$m sized objects that could hitherto not be envisaged, for instance all-optical holding of individual micro-organisms for taxonomic identification, selective collecting or tagging.},

From this reconstructed density matrix, relevant quantum information quantities such as the degree of entanglement and entropy can be calculated. Generally, orthogonal measurements have been discussed for this tomographic reconstruction. In this paper, we extend the tomographic reconstruction technique to two new regimes. First, we show how nonorthogonal measurements allow the reconstruction of the state of the system provided the measurements span the Hilbert space. We then detail how quantum-state tomography can be performed for multiqudits with a specific example illustrating how to achieve this in one- and two-qutrit systems.},

Our results show that there is an enhancement in fluctuations of localized light due to the mediumâs disorder. We find superbunching of the localized light, which may be useful for enhancing the interaction between radiation and matter. Another important consequence of sub-Poissonian statistics of the incoming light is to quench the total fluctuations at the output. Finally, we show that as a result of the multiplicative noise in the problem, the output field is far from Gaussian even if the input is a coherent field.},

We find significant new properties compared to the Ohmic spin-boson model. By reducing the TSS-HO system in the dressed states picture to a three-level system for the special case at resonance, we calculate the dephasing rates for the TSS analytically. Finally, we apply our model to experimentally realized superconducting flux qubits coupled to an underdamped dc-SQUID detector.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical forces are widely used to manipulate microparticles such as living cells, DNA and bacteria. The forces used in these ‘optical tweezers’ originate from the strongly varying electromagnetic fi eld in the focus of a high-power laser beam. This field gradient polarizes the particle, causing the positively and negatively charged sides of the dipole to experience slightly diff erent forces. It was recently realized that the strong fi eld gradient in the near-fi eld of guided wave structures can also be exploited for actuating optomechanical devices, and initial theoretical work in this area was followed rapidly by several experimental demonstrations. This Review summarizes the rapid development in this fi eld. First, the origin of the optical gradient force is discussed in detail. Several experimental demonstrations and approaches for enhancing the strength of the eff ect are then discussed. Finally, some of the possible applications of the eff ect are reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {Progress in the reliable preparation, coherent propagation and efficient detection of many-body states has recently brought collective quantum phenomena of many identical particles into the spotlight. This tutorial introduces the physics of many-boson and many-fermion interference required for the description of current experiments and for the understanding of novel approaches to quantum computing. The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated, classical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is opposed to anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and distinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale defined by the coherence length of the interfering particles. As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via the two-particle paradigm fails: in contrast to two-particle bunching and anti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and fermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The simulation of many-boson interference, termed boson-sampling, entails a qualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The problem can be tamed by an artificially designed symmetric instance, which allows a systematic understanding of coherent bosonic and fermionic signatures for arbitrarily large particle numbers, and a means to stringently assess many-particle interference. The hierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterizes multipartite entanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions. Finally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures, which dismisses the single-particle coherence length as unique indicator for interference capability. While the same physical principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the intrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more particles behave differently.},

Using a mean-field approximation to the Bose-Hubbard model, we show that the visibility of collapse and revival interference patterns reveals number squeezing of the initial superfluid state. To describe the dynamics, we use an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the intrinsic two-body and induced three-body interactions, and we analyze in detail the resulting complex pattern of collapse and revival frequencies generated by virtual transitions to higher bands, as a function of lattice parameters and mean-atom number. Our work shows that a combined analysis of both the multiband, nonstationary dynamics in the final deep lattice and the number squeezing of the initial superfluid state explains important characteristics of optical lattice collapse and revival physics. Finally, by treating the two- and three-body interaction strengths and the coefficients describing the initial superposition of number states as free parameters in a fit to the experimental data, it should be possible to go beyond some of the limitations of our model and obtain insight into the breakdown of the mean-field theory for the initial state or the role of nonperturbative effects in the final-state dynamics.},

Like in the case of the Rabi model, the spectrum of our generalized Rabi model consists of the regular and the exceptional parts. The latter is represented by the energy levels which cross at certain parameter values which we determine explicitly. The wave functions of these exceptional states are given by finite order polynomials in the Bargmann representation. The roots of these polynomials satisfy a Bethe ansatz equation of the Gaudin type. At the exceptional points the model is therefore quasiexactly solvable. An analytical approximation is derived for the regular part of the spectrum in the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit the spectrum consists of two ladders of equidistant levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Light-matter interaction is naturally described by coupled bosonic and fermionic subsystems. This suggests that a certain Bose-Fermi duality is naturally present in the fundamental quantum mechanical description of photons interacting with atoms. We reveal submanifolds in parameter space of a basic light-matter interacting system where this duality is promoted to a supersymmetry (SUSY) which remains unbroken. We show that SUSY is robust with respect to decoherence and dissipation. In particular, the stationary density matrix at the supersymmetric lines in parameter space has a degenerate subspace. The dimension of this subspace is given by the Witten index and thus is topologically protected. As a consequence, the dissipative dynamics is constrained by a robust additional conserved quantity which translates information about an initial state into the stationary state. In addition, we demonstrate that the same SUSY structures are present in condensed matter systems with spin-orbit couplings of Rashba and Dresselhaus types, and therefore spin-orbit coupled systems at the SUSY lines should be robust with respect to various types of disorder. Our findings suggest that optical and condensed matter systems at the SUSY points can be used for quantum information technology and can open an avenue for quantum simulation of SUSY field theories.},

Although electron transport in 2DEG nanostructures has been well studied, and many remarkable phenomena have already been discovered (for example, weak localization, quantum chaos, universal conductance fluctuations1,2), fundamental aspects of the electron flow through these structures have so far not been clarified. However, it has recently become possible to image current directly through 2DEG devices using scanning probe microscope techniques3â13. Here, we use such a technique to observe electron flow through a narrow constriction in a 2DEGâa quantum point contact. The images show that the electron flow from the point contact forms narrow, branching strands instead of smoothly spreading fans. Our theoretical study of this flow indicates that this branching of current flux is due to focusing of the electron paths by ripples in the background potential. The strands are decorated by interference fringes separated by half the Fermi wavelength, indicating the persistence of quantum mechanical phase coherence in the electron flow. These findings may have important implications for a better understanding of electron transport in 2DEGs and for the design of future nanostructure devices.},

In particular, the Appell transformation, which is well known in the theory of the heat equation, is reformulated in optical terms, and accordingly interpreted in the light of the propagation of given source functions, which are in a definite relation with the source functions of the original wavefunctions. Basic to the discussion is the Lie-algebra-based approach, as developed in a series of seminal papers by Kalnins, Miller and Boyer, to evolutionary-type equations, ruled by Hamiltonian operators underlying a harmonic oscillator-like symmetry algebra. Indeed, both the heat equation and the paraxial wave equation are particular cases of this kind of equation. When interpreting such an approach in terms of the propagation of assigned âsourceâ functions, the transformations between wavefunctions may be traced back to definite relations between the respective source functions. Thus, the optical Appell transformation is seen to be a manifestation of the correspondence between wavefunctions generated by eigenstates of operators, which are linked through a Fourier-similarity transformation. As a mere consequence, one can introduce the fractional Appell transformation, thus displaying a family of symmetry transformations parameterized by a continuous parameter.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate nonequilibrium phase transitions for driven atomic ensembles interacting with a cavity mode and coupled to a Markovian dissipative bath. In the thermodynamic limit and at low frequencies, we show that the distribution function of the photonic mode is thermal, with an effective temperature set by the atom-photon interaction strength. This behavior characterizes the static and dynamic critical exponents of the associated superradiance transition. Motivated by these considerations, we develop a general Keldysh path-integral approach that allows us to study physically relevant nonlinearities beyond the idealized Dicke model. Using standard diagrammatic techniques, we take into account the leading-order corrections due to the finite number N of atoms. For finite N, the photon mode behaves as a damped classical nonlinear oscillator at finite temperature. For the atoms, we propose a Dicke action that can be solved for any N and correctly captures the atoms’ depolarization due to dissipative dephasing.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantum mechanical representation suitable for studying the time evolution of quantum densities in phase space is proposed and examined in detail. This representation on L2 (2) phase space is based on definitions of the operators P̂ and Q̂ in phase space that satisfy various correspondences for the Liouville equation in classical and quantum phase space, as well as quantum position and momentum L2 (1) spaces. The definitions presented here, P̂=p/2−i∂/∂q and Q̂=q/2+i∂/∂p, are related to definitions that have been recently proposed [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 8862 (1990)]. The resulting quantum phase space representation shares many of the mathematical properties of usual representations in coordinate and momentum spaces. Within this representation, time evolution equations for complex‐valued functions(wave functions) and their square magnitudes (distribution functions) are derived, and it is shown that the coordinate and momentum space time evolution equations can be recovered by a simple Fourier projection. The phase space quantum probability conservation equation obtained is a good illustration of the quantization rule that requires one to replace the classical Poisson bracket between the Hamiltonian and the probability density with the quantum commutator between the corresponding operators. The possible classical analogs to quantum probabilities densities are also considered and some of the present results are illustrated for the dynamics of the coherent state.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantum Rabi model describes the ultrastrong interaction of a two-level atom coupled to a single quantized bosonic mode. As compared to the Jaynes–Cummings model, in the Rabi model the absorption and emission processes do not need to satisfy energy conservation and the usual rotating wave approximation (RWA) breaks down. As a result, the atom-field dynamics in the Hilbert space splits into two independent parity chains, exhibiting a collapse-revival pattern and exact periodic dynamics in the limit of degenerate atomic levels. Here we introduce a mixed Rabi Jaynes–Cummings model by considering a three-level atom interacting with two quantized bosonic fields, in which the RWA is made for one transition (with a weak atom-field coupling) but not for the other one (with an ultrastrong atom-field coupling). As a result, we show that the field in the weak coupled atomic transition can be used as a tool to control the atom-field dynamics of the other (strong coupled) transition, thus realizing an effective two-level quantum Rabi model with a controllable field. In particular, a periodic temporal dynamics of the atom-field state can be realized by appropriate tuning of the weak control field, even for non-degenerate atomic levels. A photonic simulator of the mixed Rabi Jaynes–Cummings model, based on light transport in evanescently coupled optical waveguide lattices, is also briefly discussed.},

With high but realistic cantilever quality factors, the strong coupling regime can be reached, either with single atoms or collectively with Bose-Einstein condensates.

Coupling between distant quantum-dot spins, in one and the same or different nanowires, can be efficiently performed via the resonator mode either in real time or through virtual processes. For the latter case, we derive an effective spin-entangling interaction and suggest means to turn it on and off. We consider both transverse and longitudinal types of nanowire quantum dots and compare their manipulation time scales against the spin relaxation times. For this, we evaluate the rates for spin relaxation induced by the nanowire vibrations phonons and show that, as a result of phonon confinement in the nanowire, this rate is a strongly varying function of the spin operation frequency and thus can be drastically reduced compared to lateral quantum dots in GaAs. Our scheme is a step forward to the formation of hybrid structures where qubits of different nature can be integrated in a single device.},

In this sequel, I focus on the quantum input-output relations between traveling optical and microwave fields coupled to the cavity electro-optic modulator. With red-sideband optical pumping, the relations are shown to resemble those of a beam splitter for the traveling fields, so that in the ideal case of zero parasitic loss and critical coupling, microwave photons can be coherently up converted to âflyingâ optical photons with unit efficiency, and vice versa. With blue-sideband pumping, the modulator acts as a nondegenerate parametric amplifier, which can generate two-mode squeezing and hybrid entangled photon pairs at optical and microwave frequencies. These fundamental operations provide a potential bridge between circuit quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.},

It is predicted that the modulation of the zero-point energies induces the laser-assisted tunneling LAT and the resonant peaks of the LATs are remarkably shifted in energy by the nonlinearity due to the many-body interactions. It is also shown that the threshold of the nonlinear self-interaction for the spontaneous symmetry breaking is modified by the potential modulations.

  Abstract                 = {The periodic Anderson and Kondo lattice model describe the physics of conduction electrons in extended orbitals interacting with strongly correlated electrons in localized orbitals. These models are relevant for the so-called heavy-fermion and related systems such as the Kondo insulators. In this review we summarize recent progress in the understanding of these models, in particular, the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model. The ground-state phase diagram for the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is determined and shows three distinct phases: a ferromagnetic metallic, an insulating spin liquid, and a paramagnetic metallic state. We present results on these phases obtained from rigorous and approximate analytical calculations supported by various extensive numerical studies on finite-size systems. The ferromagnetic phase appears in the limit of low density of conduction electrons and for strong Kondo coupling away from half filling. On the other hand, the half-filled Kondo lattice has a gap in both spin and charge excitations, i.e., it has a spin-liquid ground state. The paramagnetic phase may be considered as the generic heavy-fermion state and appears in the weak-coupling limit away from half filling. While the former two phases are well understood, the physics of the paramagnetic phase is not worked out in detail yet. In this context various questions will be considered here: Does the Fermi surface include conduction electrons only or also the localized electrons? Does the concept of Luttinger liquid apply in this case? The extension of these results to higher dimensions is also discussed. It is important to notice that the ground states of the Kondo lattice and the periodic Anderson model involve complicated effects, which cannot be understood by simple extension of the single- or two-impurity problem.},

We show that in a finite system the spin part of the ground state is a bipartite entangled state, which can be tested by probing two parts of the spin system separately, but only in a narrow regime around the threshold coupling. Around the resonance, the size of this regime is inversely proportional to the number of spins and shrinks down to zero for infinite systems. This spin entanglement is a non-perturbative effect and is also missed by the mean-field approximation.},

The normal-mode spectrum of devices with a high photon hopping rate t/2$\pi$ = 31 MHz shows little effect of disorder, rendering resonator arrays a good backbone for the study of condensed-matter physics with photons.},

  Abstract                 = {Blockade interactions whereby a single particle prevents the flow or excitation of other particles provide a mechanism for control of quantum states, including entanglement of two or more particles. Blockade has been observed for electrons1â3, photons4 and cold atoms5. Furthermore, dipolar interactions between highly excited atoms have been proposed as a mechanism for âRydberg blockadeâ6,7, which might provide a novel approach to a number of quantum protocols8â11. Dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms were observed several decades ago12 and have been studied recently in a many-body regime using cold atoms13â18. However, to harness Rydberg blockade for controlled quantum dynamics, it is necessary to achieve strong interactions between single pairs of atoms. Here, we demonstrate that a single Rydberg-excited rubidium atom blocks excitation of a second atom located more than 10 m away. The observed probability of double excitation is less than 20%, consistent with a theoretical model of the Rydberg interaction augmented by Monte Carlo simulations that account for experimental imperfections.},

  Abstract                 = {When the Helmholtz equation is separated in the general paraboloidal coordinate system, the three ordinary differential equations obtained each take, after a suitable change of variable, the form of the Whittaker-Hill equation. For the case k2 < 0, a considerable amount is known about the periodic solutions of this equation. The theory for k2<0 does not carry over inmmediatly to the case k2>0, and so far only perturbation solutions have been obtained. This paper gives, in sections 1-5, explicit solutions for the case k2>0, in the form of trigonometric series determined by three-term recurrence relations. In sections 6, 7 some important relations and orthogonality properties are discussed, which are of particular significance in respect of application to bounday-value problems. Section 8 discusses some degenerate cases, and in the Appendix an important property is established of continuity of the solutions with respect to the parameters of the equation},

The dynamics of the individual pulse parameters through the proposed geometries are analyzed numerically using split step Fourier method (SSFM). The steering characteristics of the coupler are demonstrated by the transmission curve. The truth tables expressing Boolean algebra for different logic operations are constructed from the transmission curves of the individual coupler configurations. Out of all configurations, we observe that the chloroform filled triangular core demonstrates all the logic operations namely OR, NOR, AND, NAND, X-OR, X-NOR and NOT with low input power. A figure of merit of logic gates (FOMEL) is also made to compare the performance of all the logic gates.},

Coherent spin states provide an alternative route to the same phase-space description of spin. The Wigner functions for spin states and transitions are exhibited up to j=2. It is shown that for Hamiltonians such as arise from time-dependent magnetic fields, the quantum spin dynamics is given entirely by the classical motion on the sphere.

The fluorescence of Er ions is exploited to image the spatial evolution of light in the two wells, clearly demonstrating suppression of light tunneling for special ratios between the frequency and amplitude of the driving field.},

The two classes are (1) “atomic coupler algorithms” decomposing a unitary transfer matrix into a planar network of 2×2 couplers, and (2) “Lie theoretic algorithms” concatenating unit cell devices with variable phase delay sets that form canonical coordinates for neighborhoods in the Lie group 𝑈(𝑁), so that the concatenations realize any transfer matrix in 𝑈(𝑁). As well as review, this paper gives (1) a Lie theoretic proof existence proof showing that both classes of algorithms work and (2) direct proofs of the efficacy of the “atomic coupler” algorithms. The Lie theoretic proof strengthens former results. 5×5 couplers designed by both methods are compared by Monte Carlo analysis, which would seem to imply atomic rather than Lie theoretic methods yield designs more resilient to manufacturing imperfections.},

After having defined the group, the paper presents a design procedure that is guaranteed to realise any transfer matrix in the group by a finite concatenation of basic building-block coupler sections. This guarantee is afforded by a simple manipulation of canonical coordinate systems for suitable neighbourhoods of the group's identity. The design procedure is illustrated for the group 6(2), where the homomorphism with 6e(3) yields geometrical insight in terms of rigid rotations of the Poincar6 sphere.

The derivation of many key results differentiates this review from the usual presentation in that they are shown to follow logically from one crucial property of relative entropy. Within the review, optimal bounds on the enhanced speed that quantum computers can achieve over their classical counterparts are outlined using information-theoretic arguments. In addition, important implications of quantum information theory for thermodynamics and quantum measurement are intermittently discussed.

Here, we model and investigate the effects of a local, two-state, quantum degree of freedom, called a pseudospin, on a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with position-dependent tunneling amplitudes and a single pair of non-Hermitian, PT -symmetric impurities.We show that if the resulting Hamiltonian is invariant under exchange of two pseudospin labels, the system can be decomposed into two uncoupled systems with tunable threshold for PT symmetry breaking. We discuss implications of our results to systems with specific tunneling profiles, and open or periodic boundary conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, waveguide lattices with nonuniform tunneling amplitudes have been explored due to their myriad tunable properties, many of which arise from the extended nature of their eigenstates in the absence of disorder. Here, we investigate the dynamics, localization, and parity- and time-reversal-symmetry (PT -symmetry) breaking in lattices that support only localized eigenstates in the disorder-free limit. We propose three families of tunneling profiles that lead to qualitatively different single-particle time evolution and show that the effects of weak disorder contain signatures of the localized or extended nature of clean-lattice eigenstates. We show that, in lattices with localized eigenstates, the signatures of PT -symmetry breaking are acutely sensitive to the initial form of the wave packet. Our results suggest that waveguide lattices with localized eigenstates will exhibit a wide array of phenomena that are absent in traditional systems.},

In the highly discrete anticontinuous limit when one of the spacings is infinite, the model reduces to an integrable chain of uncoupled dimers. From this limit, we identify the two fundamental, antisymmetric and symmetric, discrete gap solitons, which can be numerically continued to a continuum limit gap soliton at one band edge. Other composite solutions at the uncoupled limit disappear in bifurcations. Similarly to the case of waveguides with alternating widths and constant spacings, oscillatory instabilities appear for the fundamental solutions only for frequencies in the upper half of the gap. In contrast to the alternating-width case, there is no stability exchange between the two fundamental solutions: the symmetric solution is always unstable while the antisymmetric solution is always stable in the lower half of the gap. Thus, the Peierls-Nabarro barrier can vanish only in the continuum limit.},

A generic continuous field F(x,y) sampled at an N×N Cartesian grid of point sensors on a plane yields a matrix of values F(qx,qy), where (qx,qy) are integer coordinates. When the approximate rotational symmetry of the input field is important, one may use the sampled Laguerre–Gauss functions, with radial and angular modes (n,m), to analyze them into their corresponding coefficients Fn,m of energy and angular momentum (E-AM). The sampled E-AM modes span an N2-dimensional space, but are not orthogonal—except for parity. In this paper, we propose the properly orthonormal “Laguerre–Kravchuk” discrete functions Λn,m(qx,qy) as a convenient basis to analyze the sampled beams into their E-AM polar modes, and with them synthesize the input image exactly.},

It is shown that the currently accepted standard description of circuit QED via an effective model fails in an important aspect: it predicts the possibility of a superradiant phase transition, even though a full microscopic treatment reveals that a no-go theorem for such phase transitions known from cavity QED applies to circuit QED systems as well.We generalize the no-go theorem to the case of (artiﬁcial) atoms with many energy levels and thus make it more applicable for realistic cavity or circuit QED systems},

The disorder is modeled by introducing an extra random aspect to QRW, a classical coin that randomly dictates which quantum coin drives the system’s time evolution. We also show that maximal entanglement is achieved independently of the initial state of the walker, study the number of steps the system must move to be within a small fixed neighborhood of its asymptotic limit, and propose two experiments where these ideas can be tested.},

The key observation is that for any admissible one-excitation energy spectrum, the weight function of the associated OPs is uniquely prescribed. This entails the complete characterization of these PST models with the mirror-symmetry property arising as a corollary. A simple and efficient algorithm to obtain the corresponding Hamiltonians is presented. A model connected to a special case of the symmetric q-Racah polynomials is offered. An explanation of how additional models with PST can be derived from a parent system by removing energy levels from the one-excitation spectrum of the latter is given. This is achieved through Christoffel transformations and is also completely constructive in regards to the Hamiltonians.},

The analogous geometrical picture for three-level systems is presented with several applications. The relevant SU(3) group and su(3) algebra are eightdimensional objects and are realized in our picture as two four-dimensional manifolds that describe the time evolution operator. The first, called the base manifold, is the counterpart of the S2 Bloch sphere, whereas the second, called the fiber, generalizes the single U(1) phase of a single spin. Now four dimensional, it breaks down further into smaller objects depending on alternative representations that we discuss. Geometrical phases are also developed and presented for specific applications. Arbitrary time-dependent couplings between three levels or between two spins (qubits) with SU(3) Hamiltonians can be conveniently handled through these geometrical objects.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the generalization of the Landau-Zener model for a constant coupling of a finite duration. The exact evolution matrix is expressed in terms of sums of by-products of parabolic cylinder functions estimated at the turn-on time and at the turn-off time of the coupling. Various approximations in terms of simpler functions are derived and applied to several physically distinct cases. They allow us to study the dependence of the transition probability on the interaction parameters: coupling strength, coupling duration, and detuning slope. Furthermore, the analytic approximations reveal the effects of the finite coupling duration as well as those caused by adding a constant detuning shift, absence of a level crossing, turn-on time or turn-off time near the crossing ~ââhalf crossingââ!, turn-on time and turn-off time near the crossing ~âânonsubstantial crossingââ!. The results are used to obtain analytic approximations to the time evolution in the original Landau-Zener model. Furthermore, following related studies on other models, we define the Landau-Zener class of models that, along with the finite Landau-Zener model presented in this work, contains an infinite number of members that give the same transition probability. Comparison of this class to the Allen-Eberly class shows that the two classes contain members with the same coupling but different detuning chirps as well as members with the same chirp but different couplings. The former case reveals chirp effects while the latter demonstrates shape effects.},

Silicon CMOS-integrated photonics holds promise to become a technology of choice for wide deployment of low-power and cost-effective optical interconnects for these new markets, and to become a single solution addressing distances spanning from just a meter to 10km.},

The equation of motion for W(α,s) generally has derivative terms up to third order. For the Q function (s=-1) and the P function (s=1) the third-order terms vanish. The equation of motion is then a pseudo-Fokker-Planck equation, i.e., a Fokker-Planck equation where the diffusion matrix is not positive definite or semidefinite. It is shown that the equation of motion with the inclusion of third-order-derivative terms can be solved by the matrix continued-fraction method. In particular, results for the Wigner function (s=0) are presented and compared with the results of the Q function (s=-1). Furthermore, the results are compared also with those obtained from the equation of motion for the Wigner function where the third-order-derivative terms have been neglected.},

We consider the case where there is a band of parallel potential curves with slope larger (smaller) than any of the other slopes in the system. In such a situation transitions from a lower (higher) lying state within the band to any upper (lower) state are counterintuitive, since in the simple semiclassical picture they are possible only via propagation backwards in time. We rigorously prove that the probabilities of such transitions are exactly zero. In other words the energy of states within the band can only decrease (increase). The theoretical method employed is based on analysis of perturbation theory series to arbitrary order.},

The well-known statement often referred to as the “no-go theorem” asserts that the so-called A2 term, missing from the Dicke model, is relevant and prevents the system from undergoing a phase transition. At variance with this common belief, in this paper we prove that the Dicke model does give a proper description of the interaction of light ﬁeld with the internal excitation of atoms. The phase transition and the spontaneous formation of a transverse-electric mean ﬁeld cannot be excluded by principle. We point out that the proper treatment of the single-mode approximation is crucial, wherefore we present a systematic derivation of the dipole gauge inside a perfect Fabry-Perot cavity from ﬁrst principles. ´ Besides the impact on the debate around the Dicke phase transition, such a cleanup of the theoretical ground of cavity QED is important because currently there are many emerging experimental approaches to reach strong or even ultrastrong coupling between dipoles and photons, which demand a correct treatment of the Dicke model parameters.},

Destructive interferences occur for particular values of the motional amplitude. They lead to a partitioning of the motional phase space accompanied by interesting dynamical effects.

For example, a nonlinearly modiﬁed coherent ‘‘displacement’’ of the motional quantum state may induce strong amplitude squeezing and quantum interferences.},

We show that, in contrast to the Lamb-Dicke approximation, the correct treatment of the overlap of the atomic center-of-mass wave function and the driving laser waves leads to a proper dynamics without any divergence problem.

Here we performan experiment in which a superconducting twolevel system, playing the role of an artificial atom, is coupled to an on-chip cavity consisting of a superconducting transmission line resonator. We show that the strong coupling regime can be attained in a solid-state system, and we experimentally observe the coherent interaction of a superconducting two-level system with a single microwave photon. The concept of circuit quantum electrodynamics opens many new possibilities for studying the strong interaction of light and matter.

In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with lowquality factorsQand the strong coupling when high-Q cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.},

The effects of the counter-rotating-wave terms from the system–bath coherence on these quantum correlations are systematically discussed and comparisons with previous ones under the rotating-wave approximation are also performed. For two independent baths, beyond the weak system–bath coupling, the counter-rotating-wave terms essentially change evolutions of both the entanglement and quantum discord. With increase of the coupling, revival of the entanglement after a period of complete disentanglement is suppressed dramatically and ﬁnally disappears, and the quantum discord becomes smaller monotonically. For the common bath, the entanglement is also suppressed by the counter-rotating-wave terms, but the quantum discord shows quite different behaviors if initiated from spin-correlated states. In the non-Markovian regime, the quantum discord is almost not inﬂuenced by the counter-rotating-wave terms and is generally ﬁnite in the long-time evolution at arbitrary coupling while in the Markovian regime, it is signiﬁcantly enhanced with the strong coupling},

A logarithmic diverging behavior for the ﬁrst derivative of the quantum discord is also found in both models, which might be universal in the second-order quantum phase transition. It is suggested that the pronounced maximum or minimum of ﬁrst derivative of quantum discord signiﬁes the critical point. Comparisons between the quantum discord and the scaled concurrence are performed. It is shown that the quantum discord is very small in one phase and robust in the other phase, while the scaled concurrence shows maximum at the critical point and decays rapidly when away from the the critical point.},

Here we report a systematic study of the quantum tunneling property for a bright soliton, which behaves as a classical particle (wave) in the limit of small (large) incident velocity. In the intermediate regime, the classical and quantum properties are combined via a finite (but not full) discontinuity in the tunneling transmission coefficient.

  Abstract                 = {We describe an efﬁcient Monte Carlo algorithm using a random walk in energy space to obtain a very accurate estimate of the density of states for classical statistical models. The density of states is modiﬁed at each step when the energy level is visited to produce a ﬂat histogram. By carefully controlling the modiﬁcation factor, we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities such as internal energy and speciﬁc heat capacity by calculating canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations. This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases at ﬁrst-order phase transitions. In this paper, we apply our algorithm to both ﬁrst- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate its efﬁciency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models on lattices up to 2003200 and Ising models on lattices up to 2563256. Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this approach to a threedimensional 6J spin-glass model, we estimate the internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a two-dimensional random walk in energy and order-parameter space, we obtain the ~rough! canonical distribution and energy landscape in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained with more extensive application of the method. This simulational method is not restricted to energy space and can be used to calculate the density of states for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding space.},

We study the transmission of a probe field through a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a cavity and a mechanical resonator with a two-level system (qubit). The qubit might be an intrinsic defect inside the mechanical resonator, a superconducting artificial atom, or another two-level system. The mechanical resonator is coupled to the cavity field via radiation pressure and to the qubit via the Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We find that the dressed two-level system and mechanical phonon can form two sets of three-level systems. Thus, there are two transparency windows in the discussed system. We interpret this effect as an optomechanical analog of two-color EIT (or double EIT). We demonstrate how to switch between one and two EIT windows by changing the transition frequency of the qubit. We show that the absorption and dispersion of the system are mainly affected by the qubit-phonon coupling strength and the transition frequency of the qubit.},

  Abstract                 = {Although optical tweezers based on far-fields have proven highly successful for manipulating objects larger than the wavelength of light, they face difficulties at the nanoscale because of the diffraction-limited focused spot size. This has motivated interest in trapping particles with plasmonic nanostructures, as they enable intense fields confined to sub-wavelength dimensions. A fundamental issue with plasmonics, however, is Ohmic loss, which results in the water, in which the trapping is performed, being heated and to thermal convection. Here we demonstrate the trapping and rotation of nanoparticles using a template-stripped plasmonic nanopillar incorporating a heat sink. Our simulations predict an ~100-fold reduction in heating compared with previous designs. We further demonstrate the stable trapping of polystyrene particles, as small as 110 nm in diameter, which can be rotated around the nanopillar actively, by manual rotation of the incident linear polarization, or passively, using circularly polarized illumination.},

This is achieved uniquely by an appropriate motion of the mirror without the need for additional control laser or atomic level.

Based on those formalisms, we show that perfect atomic excitation by a single-photon Fock state pulse can only be realized when it is rising exponentially shaped in the even mode, a balanced superposition of the two spatial modes. A single photon from a single spatial mode can only give half of the maximal atomic excitation probability. We also show that the maximum atomic excitation probability with multiphoton pulses in the even mode is a monotonic function of the average photon number for the coherent state, but not for the Fock states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the atomic dynamics can be controlled by the initial relative phase between the two counterpropagating coherent state pulses incident on the atom, which is not the case with the two Fock state pulses.},

Sample spin arrays whose energy agreed with the ensemble average at a given temperature were taken as characteristic of that temperature and were employed to obtain instantaneous correlation functions. The results are less clear than those reported previously for three dimensional systems: The Monte Carlo calculations converged more slowly because of the lower connectivity of the lattice, and, unlike the three dimensional case, the short-range order has a range as large, or larger, than the largest sample dimensions. The results are consistent with the observation of Mermin and Wagner that the system does not order ferromagnetically at finite temperatures, and lend some credence to the conjecture of Stanley and Kaplan on the existence of a special ordered state possessing "long-ranged short-range order"},

As our implementation of perfect quantum state transfer uses a photonic setting, we introduce polarization as a new degree of freedom to the transport protocol. We demonstrate rotation operations of up to 40° on polarization during state transfer.},

We demonstrated a form of induced transparency enabled by radiation-pressure coupling of an optical and a mechanical mode. A control optical beam tuned to a sideband transition of a microoptomechanical system leads to destructive interference for the excitation of an intracavity probe field, inducing a tunable transparency window for the probe beam. Optomechanically induced transparency may be used for slowing and on-chip storage of light pulses via microfabricated optomechanical arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile tool with which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

We find overall gate times of a few 100 $\mu$s, while keeping the error probability due to vibrational excitations and spontaneous scattering below 10-3. The requirements on the positioning error and intensity noise of the optical tweezer and the magnetic field stability are analyzed and we show that atoms in optical lattices could meet the requirements for fault-tolerant scalable quantum computing.},

  Abstract                 = {Elementary parameter‐differentiation techniques are developed to systematically derive a wide variety of operator identities, expansions, and solutions to differential equations of interest to quantum physics. The treatment is largely centered around a general closed formula for the derivative of an exponential operator with respect to a parameter. Derivations are given of the Baker‐Campbell‐Hausdorff formula and its dual, the Zassenhaus formula. The continuous analogs of these formulas which solve the differential equationdY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t), the solutions of Magnus and Fer, respectively, are similarly derived in a recursive manner which manifestly displays the general repeated commutator nature of these expansions and which is quite suitable for computer programming. An expansion recently obtained by Kumar and another new expansion are shown to be derivable from the Fer and Magnus solutions, respectively, in the same way. Useful similarity transformations involving linear combinations of elements of a Lie algebra are obtained. Some cases where the product eAeB can be written as a closed form single exponential are considered which generalize results of Sack and of Weiss and Maradudin. Closed form single exponential solutions to the differential equationdY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t) are obtained for two cases and compared with the corresponding multiple exponential solutions of Wei and Norman. Normal ordering of operators is also treated and derivations, corollaries, or generalization of a number of known results are efficiently obtained. Higher derivatives of exponential and general operators are discussed by means of a formula due to Poincaré which is the operator analog of the Cauchy integral formula of complex variable theory. It is shown how results obtained by Aizu for matrix elements and traces of derivatives may be readily derived from the Poincaré formula. Some applications of the results of this paper to quantum statistics and to the Weyl prescription for converting a classical function to a quantum operator are given. A corollary to a theorem of Bloch is obtained which permits one to obtain harmonic oscillator canonical‐ensemble averages of general operators defined by the Weyl prescription. Solutions of the density matrix equation are also discussed. It is shown that an initially canonical ensemble behaves as though its temperature remains constant with a ``canonical distribution'' determined by a certain fictitious Hamiltonian.},

The formalism developed is then applied to calculate various generation probabilities analytically. We show that entanglement, starting from an initial field and an atom in one defined state may be obtained in a single step. We also show that entanglement may be built up in the case of an empty cavity and excited atoms whose final states are detected, as well as in the case when the final states of the initially excited atoms are not detected.},

The mean-field interaction induces a broadening and a shift of the peaks, and the latter is explained by an analytic perturbation theory.},

Until now, it has never been rigorously defined, so it has not been known (for example) what mixed states are steerable (that is, can be used to exhibit steering). We provide an operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell nonlocality. For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we relate this to the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.},

The many-particle problem can be solved approximately within an independent crossings approximation, which yields an explicit generalized Landau-Zener formula.

In addition, we find a stationary qubit-field entangled basis that governs the whole dynamics as the coupling strength overcomes the mode frequency.},

The scale between the two bases is calibrated on the ground state of the field. We conclude that mode analysis is better approximated in the nonorthogonal sampled Hermite–Gauss basis, while signal restoration in the Kravchuk basis is exact.},

  Abstract                 = {In quantum optimal control theory, kinematic bounds are the minimum and maximum values of the control objective achievable for any physically realizable system dynamics. For a given initial state of the system, these bounds depend on the nature and state of the controller. We consider a general situation where the controlled quantum system is coupled to both an external classical field (referred to as a classical controller) and an auxiliary quantum system (referred to as a quantum controller). In this general situation, the kinematic bound is between the classical kinematic bound (CKB), corresponding to the case where only the classical controller is available, and the quantum kinematic bound (QKB), corresponding to the ultimate physical limit of the objective’s value. Specifically, when the control objective is the expectation value of a quantum observable (a Hermitian operator on the system’s Hilbert space), the QKBs are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of this operator. We present, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the necessary and sufficient conditions for surpassing the CKB and reaching the QKB, through the use of a quantum controller. The general conditions are illustrated by examples in which the system and controller are initially in thermal states. The obtained results provide a basis for the design of quantum controllers capable of maximizing the control yield and reaching the ultimate physical limit.},

We obtain an exact transformed Hamiltonian in which one of the three levels is decoupled for all values of the detunings.

In this way, we provide a long-sought solution of a cascade of models with immediate relevance in different physical fields, including (i) quantum optics, a two-level atom in single-mode cross-electric and magnetic fields; (ii) solid-state physics, electrons in semiconductors with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling; and (iii) mesoscopic physics, Josephson-junction flux-qubit quantum circuits.},

The average is done over the initial distribution of the states of one of the subsystems. In this paper, we extend the expression of the partial entangling power to the case that d1 is finite and d2 is arbitrary. In particular, we give an explicit expression of partial entangling power for the 2Ã$\infty$system. The expression can be well applicable to the JaynesâCummings model (JCM). The results can recover the well-known phenomenon in the JCM. We explicitly discuss its behaviour in the large detuning case and at the resonance case. Comparing the two cases, we find that it is easier for the JCM in the large detuning case to reach and maintain its maximum entangling power, while for the JCM at resonance, the achievable maximum entangling power is larger. In addition, the time average partial entangling power is also discussed.},

Then characteristics of almost-periodic grating slab waveguidescan be obtained by multiplying each F matrix of a short segment with the proper grating phase conditions at the interface between two adjacent segments. The appropriateness of this approach is shown for typical aperiodic grating waveguides such as tapered, chirped, and phase-shifted gratings. The results obtained by this method are compared with others and prove to be in good agreement with the results obtained by other methods. In addition to these characteristics, it is shown that the F matrix can be used to obtain the threshold conditions for distributed feedback laser oscillations including reflections from cleaved edges.},

  Abstract                 = {I t is shown that the rotating wave approximation in the minimal coupling Hamiltonian with the A2 term leads to an incorrect energy spectrum of the polariton mode: in particular, to a spurious polariton instability which should not occur for a photon-matter system consisting of radiation and atoms without the Coulomb interaction. Thus the counter-rotating term in the presence of the Aâ term plays a crucial role in the instability property of the system. The super-radiant phase transition in the Dicke model is shown to be accompanied by polariton instability, and therefore by instability of the ground state of the photon-matter system. The rotating wave approximation, as well as the neglect of the A 2 term, should therefore nor be made for the study of the thermodynamic phase transition and instability properties of the ground state of the system. 1. Introduction In general, a truncated Hamiltonian gives an approximate energy spectrum and an approximate equation of motion which differs from the original correct one. Therefore its validity is limited to particular usage. In quantum optics, the counter-rotating term, the A2 term and the P term are often truncated in the basic Hamiltonian in order to â simplify the calculation. If the A2term is omitted, however, the resulting field equation for the vector potential A(r, t ) contains an extra term which makes the state A = 0 unstable (Yamanoi 1976).Similarly, if the P term in the dipole coupling Hamiltonian is â omitted, an extra term P ( t ) for polarisation is introduced in the equation of motion, making the state P = 0 unstable (Yamanoi and Takatsuji 1977). In other words, the consequence of these extra terms is to make the polariton mode with eigenfrequency w soft ( w + 0) and finally unstable ( w 2< 0) under some threshold condition (polariton instability). However, the above-mentioned instability does not represent the true dynamical property of the photon-matter system, because this is originated entirely in the truncation of the Aâ or the P term. â Since the polariton mode is a small oscillation of fields A and P about the state A = P = 0 (the ground state in which t h e photon is absent and all atoms are in their lowest states), the polariton instability means the instability of the ground state of the photon-matter system, indicating the appearance of a new ground state (A f 0, P f 0) with energy lower than the normal ground state (A = P = 0). Only when we consider a situation where each of these extra terms does not play any crucial role, we can use the approximate Hamiltonian without the Aâ or the P2 term to study electromagnetic phenomena which have nothing to do with the instability of the ground state of the photon-matter system.},

The Nth-order rogue wave solutions with 2N + 1 free complex parameters are constructed via the generalized Darboux transformation method. As applications, rogue waves from the first to the fifth order are calculated according to different combinations of parameters. In particular, rogue waves dynamics and several new spatial–temporal structures are also discussed and exhibited to make a comparison with those of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.},

Because of employing a first-order large detuning, the gate can be performed fast when compared with the use of a second-order large detuning. Furthermore, the gate operation time is independent of the number of qubits. This proposal is quite general and can be applied to various superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator, nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled to a microsphere cavity, or quantum dots in cavity QED.},

As a result, both the groundand excited-state-energy spectrums and wave functions can be derived easily. Moreover, these explicit results agree well with the direct numerical simulation in a wide range of the experimental parameters. In addition, based on our obtained energy spectrums, the recent experimental observation of the Bloch-Siegert shift in the circuit quantum electrodynamics with ultrastrong coupling can be explained perfectly.

This defining signature of SUSY can be probed by single-particle spectroscopies. Thermal breaking of SUSY at a finite temperature is accompanied by a thermal Goldstone fermion, i.e., phonino excitation. This and other signatures of broken SUSY can also be probed experimentally.},

In particular, it is found that stable amplification of the quantum discord exists for the case of two identical qubits, and the quantum discord can be protected for the case of two different qubits with a large detuning. It is also indicated that in general a sudden change of the quantum discord occurs in the time evolution at a critical time point tc, and the discord amplification and protection may occur only in the time interval 0 < t  tc for certain X-type states.

It is a simple generalization of the well-known minimum uncertainty wave packets. The detailed properties of two-photon coherent states are developed and distinguished from ordinary coherent states. These two-photon coherent states are mathematically generated from coherent states through unitary operators associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. Physically they are the radiation states of ideal two-photon lasers operating far above threshold, according to the self-consistent field approximation. The mean-squared quantum noise behavior of these states, which is basically the same as those of minimum uncertainty states, leads to applications not obtainable from coherent states or one-photon lasers. The essential behavior of two-photon coherent states is unchanged by small losses in the system. The counting rates or distributions these states generate in photocount experiments also reveal their difference from coherent states.},

The transmission and reﬂection amplitudes for the single-photon propagation in such a hybrid system are deduced via a real-space approach. Several new phenomena such as phase-coupled induced transparency, single-photon switches, symmetric and asymmetric bifrequency photon attenuators are analyzed. In addition, the dissipation effect of such a hybrid system is also discussed.},

The extremely strong axial component of a highly focused radially polarized beam provides a large gradient force. Meanwhile, this strong axial field component does not contribute to the Poynting vector along the optical axis. Consequently, it does not create axial scattering/absorption forces. Owing to the spatial separation of the gradient force and scattering/absorption forces, a stable 3-D optical trap for metallic particles can be formed.},

We map the original Hamiltonian to an effective one, which describes a tight-binding chain subjected to a staggered linear potential. It is shown that the photon probability distribution of a Gaussian-type state exhibits amplitude-modulated Bloch oscillations (BOs), which are a superposition of two conventional BOs with a half-BO-period delay between them and are essentially another type of Bloch–Zener oscillation. The probability transition between the two BOs can be controlled and suppressed by the ratio $g\sqrt{{\bar{n}}}/\omega $, as well as the in-phase resonant oscillating atomic frequency Ω (t), leading to multiple zero-transition points.},

In this paper we consider self-sustained oscillations of a cavity-field-driven oscillator combined with quadratic coupling in a blue-detuned regime above a pumping threshold. Our study finds that the oscillator will be far away from its steady-state behavior by conducting a self-sustained oscillation with a discrete amplitude locking effect producing a rich energy-balanced structure. The dynamical backaction of this self-oscillation on the field mode induces a multipeak field spectrum, which implies an efficient harmonic generation with its intensity modified not only by the displacement x0 but also by the amplitude A of the mechanical oscillation. The corresponding nonlinear field spectrum and its magnitude are analytically analyzed with quadratic coupling when the mechanical oscillator is dynamically locked to a self-sustained oscillation.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the evolution of asymmetric self-accelerating finite energy Airy pulses (FEAP) in optical fibers with emphasis on the role of Raman scattering. We show that the Raman-induced frequency shift (RIFS) of soliton initiated by an asymmetric self-accelerating FEAP depends not only on the launched peak power but also on the truncation coefficient imposed on the asymmetric self-accelerating FEAP. We find that the RIFS of asymmetric self-accelerating FEAP increases with a decrease in the truncation coefficient, while the peak power and spectrum width of the outermost red shift of the shedding soliton spectrum are almost unchanged. The time and frequency shifts of the shedding soliton are found to be sensitive to the truncation coefficient when the truncation coefficient is in the range of 0 to 0.1. These excellent features would lead to the realization of a RIFS-based tunable light source by launching self-accelerating FEAP with different truncation coefficient into an optical fiber.},

The system we suggest is a planar interface superposed by a negative index metamaterial (NIMM) and a dielectric, where three-level quantum emitters are doped. By using the ARG from the quantum emitters and the destructive interference effect between the electric and magnetic responses from the NIMM, we show that not only the Ohmic loss of the NIMM but also the light absorption of the quantum emitters can be completely eliminated. As a result, non-diffractive Airy SPs may propagate for very long distance without attenuation. We also show that the Kerr nonlinearity of the system can be largely enhanced due to the introduction of the quantum emitters and hence lossless Airy surface polaritonic solitons with very low power can be generated in the system.},

Thus the topological and algebraic structure of the coherent states as well as the associated dynamical system can be extensively discussed. In addition, a quantum-mechanical phase-space representation is constructed via the coherent-state theory. Several useful methods for employing the coherent states to study the physical phenome of quantum-dynamic systems, such as the path integral, variational principle, classical limit, and thermodynamic limit of quantum mechanics, are described.},

Fundamental solitons in tightly knit lattices, as well as all dipole modes, exist above a finite threshold value of the total power. However, the threshold vanishes for fundamental solitons in loosely knit lattices. The stability of the discrete solitons is investigated analytically by means of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) criterion, and, in the full form, via the computation of eigenvalues for perturbation modes. Fundamental and dipole solitons tend to be stable at smaller and larger values of the total power (norm), respectively. The increase of the strength of the coupling between the two defect-forming sites leads to strong expansion of the stability areas. The scattering problem for linear lattice waves impinging upon the defect is considered too.},

Cold atoms in optical lattices, in particular, represent a paradigmatic system, for which the quantum phase transition between the superfluid and Mott insulator states can be externally induced by tuning the microscopic parameters. In this paper, we describe our approach to study quantum criticality of cesium atoms in a twodimensional (2D) lattice based on in situ density measurements. Our research agenda involves testing critical scaling of thermodynamic observables and extracting transport properties in the quantum critical regime. We present and discuss experimental progress on both fronts. In particular, the thermodynamic measurement suggests that the equation of state near the critical point follows the predicted scaling law at low temperatures.},

In general, the higher the intensities of interacting beams, the easier to form solitons; when the intensities are small enough, no solitons are generated. Upon adjusting the interval between the launched beams, their interaction exhibits different properties.

  Abstract                 = {The attractive Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice exhibits, at half filling, a quantum critical point between a semimetal with massless Dirac fermions and an s-wave superconductor (SC). We study the BCS-BEC crossover in this model away from half filling at zero temperature and show that the appropriately defined crossover line (in the interaction-density plane) passes through the quantum critical point at half filling. For a range of densities around half filling, the ''underlying Fermi surface'' of the SC, defined as the momentum space locus of minimum energy quasiparticle excitations, encloses an area which changes nonmonotonically with interaction. We also study fluctuations in the SC and the semimetal, and show the emergence of an undamped Leggett mode deep in the SC. Finally, we consider possible implications for ultracold atoms in optical lattices and the high temperature SCs.},

With infinite components, the combined beams have a smaller focal spot, a longer focal length, and can morph into nondiffracting Bessel beams in their far field. Through numerical simulation comparisons of the propagation dynamics of these beams with those of other combined beams, it can be seen that these beams exhibit better focusing features.},

We present the exact many-body scattering eigenstate obtained by imposing open boundary conditions. Multiphoton bound states appear in the scattering of two or more photons due to the coupling between the photons and the TLS. Such bound states are shown to have a large effect on scattering of both Fock- and coherent-state wave packets, especially in the intermediate coupling-strength regime. We compare the statistics of the transmitted light with a coherent state having the same mean photon number: as the interaction strength increases, the one-photon probability is suppressed rapidly, and the two- and three-photon probabilities are greatly enhanced due to the many-body bound states.

By imposing a gradient in the propagation constant in each array, BlochâZener oscillation (BZO) is realized with Zener tunneling between the bands occurring at the midzone, which is contrary to the common BZO with tunneling at the center or edge of the Brillouin zone. The occurrence of BZO is demonstrated by using the fieldevolution analysis. The tunable hybridization at the midzone enhances the tunability of BZO in the OWLs.

Our approach, which uses discrete coordinates, unifies low and high energy effective theories for single-photon scattering. We show that the controllable two-level system can behave as a quantum switch for the coherent transport of a single photon. This study may inspire new electrooptical single-photon quantum devices. We also suggest an experimental setup based on superconducting transmission line resonators and qubits.},

Finally, to verify the theoretical analysis, the tightly focused fields are measured based on a confocal microscopy system when the NA of the objective lens is 0.90.

Whenever this detuning is large compared to relevant coupling strengths, the system is said to be in the dispersive regime. The physics of this regime is well-understood at the level of a single Jaynes–Cummings or Rabi site. Here, we extend the theoretical description of the dispersive regime to lattices with many sites, for both strong and ultra-strong coupling. We discuss the nature and spatial range of the resulting qubit–qubit and photon–photon coupling, demonstrate the emergence of photon-pairing and squeezing and illustrate our results by exact diagonalization of the Rabi dimer.},

We review and modify the presentation of Legendre transforms in a way that explicates the formal mathematics, resulting in manifestly symmetric equations, thereby clarifying the structure of the transform. We then discuss examples to motivate the transform as a way of choosing independent variables that are more easily controlled. We demonstrate how the Legendre transform arises naturally from statistical mechanics and show how the use of dimensionless thermodynamic potentials leads to more natural and symmetric relations.

The system ground state is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of dimer bound states in the low-density limit and a paired superfluid (BCS) state in the high-density limit. At zero temperature, the intralayer repulsion is found to broaden the regime of BCS-BEC crossover and can potentially induce system collapse through the softening of roton excitations. The BCS theory and the strongly coupled dimer picture yield similar predictions for the parameters of the crossover regime. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the dimer superfluid is also calculated. The crossover can be driven by many-body effects and is strongly affected by the intralayer interaction which was ignored in previous studies.},

That enables the simulation of CQED in 2 þ 1 dimensions in both the weak and the strong coupling regimes, hence, allowing us to probe confinement as well as other nonperturbative effects of the theory.

A phase-space representation allows an efficient numerical implementation of the resulting master equation. It provides reliable results which are valid even for rather low temperatures. We find that the spin-flip probability as a function of temperature and dissipation strength exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour. Our numerical results are complemented by analytical solutions for zero temperature and for vanishing dissipation strength.},

The main tool in this reformulation is the use of projection operators in the Hilbert space of Gibbsian ensemble densities. Projection operators are used to separate an ensemble density into a "relevant" part, needed for the calculation of mean values of specified observables, and the remaining "irrelevant" part. The relevant part is shown to satisfy a kinetic equation which is a generalization of Van Hove's "master equation to general order." Diagram summation methods are not used. The formalism is illustrated by a new derivation of the Prigogine-Brout master equation for a classical weakly interacting system.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase transitions are dramatic phenomena: water freezes into ice, atomic spins spontaneously align in a magnet, and liquid helium becomes superfluid. Sometimes, such a drastic change in behaviour is accompanied by a visible change in appearance. The hallmark of BoseâEinstein condensation and superfluidity in trapped, weakly interacting Bose gases is the sudden formation of a dense central core inside a thermal cloud1â7. However, in strongly interacting gasesâsuch as the recently observed fermionic superfluids8âthere is no longer a clear separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud. The detection of fermion pair condensates has required magnetic field sweeps9â11 into theweakly interacting regime, and the quantitative description of these sweeps presents a major theoretical challenge. Here we report the direct observation of the superfluid phase transition in a strongly interacting gas of 6Li fermions, through sudden changes in the shape of the cloudsâin complete analogy to the case of weakly interacting Bose gases. By preparing unequal mixtures of the two spin components involved in the pairing12,13, we greatly enhance the contrast between the superfluid core and the normal component. Furthermore, the distribution of non-interacting excess atoms serves as a direct and reliable thermometer. Even in the normal state, strong interactions significantly deform the density profile of the majority spin component. We show that it is these interactions that drive the normal-to-superfluid transition at the critical population imbalance of 70 6 5 per cent (ref. 12).},

The cavity is driven by a weak laser field while the QD is driven by another weak laser field. Due to the quantum destructive interference arisen from different transition channels induced by simultaneously driving the QD-cavity system in terms of the two different lasers, two-photon absorption for the cavity field can be effectively eliminated by performing an optimal quantum interference condition. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the QD-cavity system can be unbalancedly prepared in two single-polariton states with different eigenenergies. If the frequency of the NMR is tuned to be resonant with transition between two single-polariton states, it is found that a fast ground-state cooling for the NMR can also be achieved, even when the QD-cavity system is originally in the moderate-coupling regime. Thus the present ground-state cooling scheme for the NMR may be realized with currently available experimental technology.},

Furthermore, the cavity response exhibits superharmonic resonances (SHR) when the ratio between the qubit frequency and the cavity fundamental mode frequency is tuned close to an integer value. The nonlinear response is characterized by the method of intermodulation and both signal and idler gains are measured. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions and good qualitative agreement is obtained. The SHRs have potential for applications in quantum amplification and generation of entangled states of light.},

By solving numerically the master equation in the dressed-state basis, we compute the output field correlation functions in the steady-state for a wide range of coupling rates. We find that, as the atom-cavity coupling strength increases, the system undergoes multiple transitions in the photon statistics. In particular, a first sharp antibunching-to-bunching transition, occurring at g~0.45ωc, leading to the breakdown of the photon blockade due to the counter-rotating terms, is shown to be the consequence of a parity shift in the energy spectrum. A subsequent revival of the photon blockade and the emergence of the quasicoherent statistics for even larger coupling rates are attributed to an interplay between the nonlinearity in the energy spectrum and the transition rates between the dressed states.},

While its center-of-mass motion has been investigated intensively, its torsional vibration has only been studied theoretically in limited cases. Here we report the first experimental observation of the torsional vibration of an optically levitated nonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum. We achieve this by utilizing the coupling between the spin angular momentum of photons and the torsional vibration of a nonspherical nanoparticle whose polarizability is a tensor. The torsional vibration frequency can be 1 order of magnitude higher than its center-of-mass motion frequency, which is promising for ground state cooling. We propose a simple yet novel scheme to achieve ground state cooling of its torsional vibration with a linearly polarized Gaussian cavity mode. A levitated nonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum will also be an ultrasensitive nanoscale torsion balance with a torque detection sensitivity on the order of 10−29  N m/Sqrt(Hz) under realistic conditions.},

We calculate absorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also by the Maxwell boundary conditions in the framework of the classical electrodynamics, which we consider the most reliable approach. We found that, compared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra by the non-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions. Although the discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultrastrong light-matter interaction regime with a relatively large broadening, the master equation of the non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the Lindblad one for pursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.},

Talbot images form along certain central angles, which are referred to as Talbot angles. The fractional nonparaxial Talbot effect is obtained by choosing the coefficients of beam components properly.

In particular, it is shown that in a linear tight-binding chain a quantum state can be transformed into its mirror image with respect to the center of the chain after a controllable time. As compared to a quantum mirror image based on coherent transport in a static chain with properly tailored inhomogeneous hopping rates, our method does not require hopping rate engineering and is less sensitive to disorder for long transfer times.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to give an explicit construction of the Fock spaces of the parafermion and the paraboson algebra, for an infinite set of generators. This is equivalent to constructing certain unitary irreducible lowest weight representations of the (infinite rank) Lie algebra so(∞) and of the Lie superalgebra osp(1|∞). A complete solution to the problem is presented, in which the Fock spaces have basis vectors labeled by certain infinite but stable Gelfand–Zetlin patterns, and the transformation of the basis is given explicitly. Alternatively, the basis vectors can be expressed as semi-standard Young tableaux.},

  abstract = {We show that a single para-Bose oscillator may be regarded as a deformed Bose oscillator. We construct a nonlinear realization of the single-mode para-Bose algebra in terms of a single boson. This is in  contrast to the Green decomposition that expresses a single para-Bose oscillator in terms of p anticommuting bosons. We also construct an operator canonically conjugate to the para-Bose annihilation operator that permits us to carry over familiar constructions to the para-Bosonic case.},

The oscillatory behavior of the excited states is discussed. The results are applied to both systems},

  abstract = {The energy, position, and momentum eigenstates of a para-Bose oscillator system were considered in paper I.

This brings in, in a natural way, the coherent states Iz;a) defined as the eigenstates of the annihilation operator ii. The transformation functions relating this description to the energy, position, and momentum eigenstates are explicitly obtained. Possible resolution of the identity operator using coherent states is examined. A particular resolution contains two
integrals, one containing the diagonal basis Iz;a) (z;a 1 and the other containing the pseudodiagonal basis Iz;a) ( - z;a I. We briefly consider the normal and antinormal ordering of the operators and their diagonal and discrete diagonal coherent state approximations. The problem of constructing states with a minimum value of the product of the position and momentum uncertainties and the possible a dependence of this minimum value is considered.},
